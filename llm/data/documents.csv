Simulations of organized traffic frequently involve queuing theory, stochastic processes and equations of mathematical physics applied to traffic flow.\n\n\n== Etymology and types ==\n\nThe word traffic originally meant ""trade"" (as it still does) and comes from the Old Italian verb trafficare and noun traffico.  The origin of the Italian words is unclear. Suggestions include Catalan trafegar ""decant"", an assumed Vulgar Latin verb transfricare \'rub across\', an assumed Vulgar Latin combination of trans- and facere \'make or do\', Arabic tafriq \'distribution\', and Arabic taraffaqa, which can mean \'seek profit\'. Broadly, the term covers many kinds of traffic including network traffic, air traffic, marine traffic and rail traffic, but it is often used narrowly to mean only road traffic.\n\n\n== Rules of the road ==\n\nRules of the road and driving etiquette are the general practices and procedures that road users are required to follow. These rules usually apply to all road users, though they are of special importance to motorists and cyclists. These rules govern interactions between vehicles and pedestrians. The basic traffic rules are defined by an international treaty under the authority of the United Nations, the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. Not all countries are signatory to the convention and, even among signatories, local variations in practice may be found. There are also unwritten local rules of the road, which are generally understood by local drivers.\nAs a general rule, drivers are expected to avoid a collision with another vehicle and pedestrians, regardless of whether or not the applicable rules of the road allow them to be where they happen to be.\nIn addition to the rules applicable by default, traffic signs and traffic lights must be obeyed, and instructions may be given by a police officer, either routinely (on a busy crossing instead of traffic lights) or as road traffic control around a construction zone, accident, or other road disruption.\n\n\n=== Directionality ===\n\nTraffic heading in inverse ways ought to be isolated so as to not hinder each other\'s way. The most essential guideline is whether to utilize the left or right half of the street.\n\n\n=== Traffic regulations ===\n\nIn many countries, the rules of the road are codified, setting out the legal requirements and punishments for breaking them.\nIn the United Kingdom, the rules are set out in the Highway Code, which includes not only obligations but also advice on how to drive sensibly and safely.\nIn the United States, traffic laws are regulated by the states and municipalities ')","('metadata', {'title': 'Traffic', 'summary': ""Traffic comprises pedestrians, vehicles, ridden or herded animals, trains, and other conveyances that use public ways (roads/sidewalks) for travel and transportation.\nTraffic laws govern and regulate traffic, while rules of the road include traffic laws and informal rules that may have developed over time to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic.

"('page_content', 'A traffic collision, also known as a motor vehicle collision, or car crash, occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or other moving or stationary obstruction, such as a tree, pole or building. Traffic collisions often result in injury, disability, death, and property damage as well as financial costs to both society and the individuals involved. Road transport is statistically the most dangerous situation people deal with on a daily basis, but casualty figures from such incidents attract less media attention than other, less frequent types of tragedy. The commonly used term car accident is increasingly falling out of favor with many government departments and organizations, with the Associated Press style guide recommending caution before using the term. Some collisions are intentional vehicle-ramming attacks, staged crashes, vehicular homicide or vehicular suicide.\nSeveral factors contribute to the risk of collisions, including vehicle design, speed of operation, road design, weather, road environment, driving skills, impairment due to alcohol or drugs, and behavior, notably aggressive driving, distracted driving, speeding and street racing.\n\nIn 2013, 54 million people worldwide sustained injuries from traffic collisions. This resulted in 1.4 million deaths in 2013, up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990. About 68,000 of these occurred with children less than five years old. Almost all high-income countries have decreasing death rates, while the majority of low-income countries have increasing death rates due to traffic collisions. Middle-income countries have the highest rate with 20 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, accounting for 80% of all road fatalities with 52% of all vehicles. While the death rate in Africa is the highest (24.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), the lowest rate is to be found in Europe (10.3 per 100,000 inhabitants).\n\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nTraffic collisions can be classified by general types. Types of collision include head-on, road departure, rear-end, side collisions, and rollovers.\nMany different terms are commonly used to describe vehicle collisions. The World Health Organization uses the term road traffic injury, while the U.S. Census Bureau uses the term motor vehicle accidents (MVA), and Transport Canada uses the term ""motor vehicle traffic collision"" (MVTC). Other common terms include auto accident, car accident, car crash, car smash, car wreck, motor vehicle collision (MVC), personal injury collision (PIC), road accident, road traffic accident (RTA), road traffic collision (RTC), and road traffic incident (RTI) as well as more unofficial terms including smash-up, pile-up, and fender bender.\n\n\n=== Criticism of ""accident"" terminology ===\nMany organizations, companies and government agencies have begun to avoid the term accident, instead preferring terms such as collision, crash or incident. This is because the term accident may imply that there is no one to blame or that the collision was unavoidable, whereas most traffic collisions are the result of driving under the influence, excessive speed, distractions such as mobile phones, other risky behavior, poor road design, or other preventable factors.\nIn 1997, George L. Reagle, the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration wrote a letter stating that ""A crash is not an accident"", emphasizing that the Department\'s Research and Special Programs Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had all declared that ""accident"" should be avoided in their published writings and media communications. In 2016, the Associated Press updated its style guide to recommend that journalists use ""crash, collision, or other terms"" rather than ""accident"" unless culpability is proven. The AP also recommends avoiding ""accident"" when negligence is proven or claimed because the term ""can be read as exonerating the person responsib')","('metadata', {'title': 'Traffic collision', 'summary': 'A traffic collision, also known as a motor vehicle collision, or car crash, occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or other moving or stationary obstruction, such as a tree, pole or building.

"('page_content', 'Traffic signs or road signs are signs erected at the side of or above roads to give instructions or provide information to road users. The earliest signs were simple wooden or stone milestones. Later, signs with directional arms were introduced, for example the fingerposts in the United Kingdom and their wooden counterparts in Saxony.\n\nWith traffic volumes increasing since the 1930s, many countries have adopted pictorial signs or otherwise simplified and standardized their signs to overcome language barriers, and enhance traffic safety. Such pictorial signs use symbols (often silhouettes) in place of words and are usually based on international protocols. Such signs were first developed in Europe, and have been adopted by most countries to varying degrees.\n\n\n== International conventions ==\nInternational conventions such as Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals and Geneva Convention on Road Traffic have helped to achieve a degree of uniformity in traffic signing in various countries. Countries have also unilaterally (to some extent) followed other countries in order to avoid confusion.\n\n\n== Categories ==\n\nTraffic signs can be grouped into several types. For example, Annexe 1 of the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (1968), which on 30 June 2004 had 52 signatory countries, defines eight categories of signs:\n\nA. Danger warning signs\nB.

Advance directional signs appear at a certain distance from the interchange, giving information for each direction. A number of countries do not give information for the road ahead (so-called ""pull-through"" signs), and only for the directions left and right. Advance directional signs enable drivers to take precautions for the exit (e.g., switch lanes, double check whether this is the correct exit, slow down).\nThey often do not appear on lesser roads, but are normally posted on expressways and motorways, as drivers would be missing exits without them. While each nation has its own system, the first approach sign for a motorway exit is mostly placed at least 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) from the actual interchange. After that sign, one or two additional advance directional signs typically follow before the actual interchange itself.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest road signs were milestones, giving distance or direction; for example, the Romans erected stone columns throughout their empire giving the distance to Rome. According to Strabo, Mauryas erected signboards at distance of 10 stades to mark their roads. In the Middle Ages, multidirectional signs at intersections became common, giving directions to cities and towns.\nIn 1686, the first known Traffic Regulation Act in Europe was established by King Peter II of Portugal. This act foresaw the placement of priority signs in the narrowest streets of Lisbon, stating which traffic should back up to give way. One of these signs still exists at Salvador street, in the neighborhood of Alfama.\nThe first modern road signs erected on a ')","('metadata', {'title': 'Traffic sign', 'summary': 'Traffic signs or road signs are signs erected at the side of or above roads to give instructions or provide information to road users.

"('page_content', 'Road signs in the United Kingdom and in its associated Crown dependencies and overseas territories conform broadly to European design norms, though a number of signs are unique: direction signs omit European route numbers, and road signs generally use the imperial system of units (miles and yards), unlike the rest of Europe (kilometres and metres). Signs in Wales and parts of Scotland are bilingual.\nA range of signs are used on British roads, such as motorway signs, warning signs and regulatory signs.\nThe United Kingdom signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals on 8 November 1968 but has yet to fully ratify it.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nModern British road signage can be traced to the development of the ""ordinary"" bicycle and the establishment of clubs to further the interests of its riders, notably the Cyclists\' Touring Club (CTC), the National Cyclists\' Union (NCU) and the Scottish Cyclists\' Union (SCU). By the early 1880s, all three organisations were erecting their own cast-iron ""danger boards"". Importantly, these signs warned of hazards, rather than just stating distances or giving direction to places, acknowledging the fact that cyclists, like modern motorists, were unlikely to be familiar with the roads they were travelling along and were moving too fast to take avoiding action without prior warning. In addition, it was the cycling lobby that successfully pressured the government in 1888 into vesting ownership of and responsibility for roads with county councils in previously established highway districts that would be funded from taxation rather than tolls. The districts were active in the erection of semi-standardised directional signs and mileposts in the latter years of the 19th century.\n\nThe rise of motoring after 1896 saw the pattern repeated. The larger motoring clubs, notably The Automobile Association (AA) and the Royal Scottish Automobile Club (RSAC) erected their own, idiosyncratic warning boards and direction signs on a wide scale. Under the Motor Car Act 1903 four national signs were created which were to be set at least 8 ft (2.4 m) from the ground and 50 yards (46 m) from their reference point. These signs were distinguished based on their shape, rather than a symbol or writing on them. These included a white ring meaning speed limited (as marked on a small information plate below it); a white (sometimes red) diamond for a ""motor notice"" such as a weight restriction (given on a plate below); a red disc for a prohibition; and a red open triangle for a hazard or warning. The latter two could provide more detail by having an information plate below them, but often it was left to the motorist to guess what the sign was referring to, and it was common to have variations between different local areas for what was a prohibition or just a ""notice"". This format was to develop into the British road sign that was standard from 1934 until 1964. Before this time regulations for traffic signs were published under powers created by the Road Traffic Act 1930 and so national road signage specifications were only advisory.\n\nFollowing a review of national signage in 1921, a limited number of warning and hazard information plates also used symbols, rather than only text. Such symbols had been developed in continental Europe as early as 1909, but before this had been dismissed by the UK which favoured the use of text. The symbols were simple silhouettes which were easy to recognise at a distance. Some were unusual, such as \'SCHOOL\' (and later \'CHILDREN\') was depicted by the \'flaming torch of knowledge\'. The government made increasing efforts to standardise road signs in the Road Traffic Act 1930 (RTA) and regulations of 1933, being finally consolidated with the publication of the 1934 Road Traffic Acts and Regulations handbook. These saw the end of non-standard permanent signs being erected by motoring clubs, such as the black and yellow vitreous enamel AA signs (although this did not include temporary direction signs).

In some countries and areas (France, Italy, Czech Republic, Slovakia etc.), road markings are conceived as horizontal traffic signs, as opposed to vertical traffic signs placed on posts.\nRoad surface markings are used on paved roadways to provide guidance and information to drivers and pedestrians. Uniformity of the markings is an important factor in minimizing confusion and uncertainty about their meaning, and efforts exist to standardize such markings across borders. However, countries and areas categorize and specify road surface markings in different ways—white lines are called white lines mechanical, non-mechanical, or temporary.

Road surface marking can also indicate regulations for parking and stopping.\nThere is continuous effort to improve the road marking system, and technological breakthroughs include adding retroreflectivity, increasing longevity, and lowering installation cost.\nToday, road markings are used to convey a range of information to the driver spanning navigational, safety and enforcement issues leading to their use in road environment understanding within advanced driver-assistance systems and consideration for future use in autonomous road vehicles.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Mechanical markers ==\n\nMechanical devices may be raised or recessed into the road surface, and either reflective or non-reflective. Most are permanent; some are movable.\n\nCat's eye, invented by Percy Shaw in the 1930s, Cat's eyes equip many major routes in the British Isles. They consist of four reflective lenses mounted in a durable white rubber housing, two facing fore and two facing aft. The housing is mounted within a cast iron shoe, which the rubber housing sinks in to when driven over. This provides protection from snow plowing and allows the lenses to be self-cleaning—they pass a rubber blade when depressed. The lenses are available in a variety of different colors, mainly white, yellow/orange, green, red, and blue.\nBotts' dots (low rounded white or yellow dots), named for the California Caltrans engineer Elbert Botts, who invented the epoxy that keeps them glued down, are one type of a mechanical non-reflective raised marker. Generally they are used to mark the edges of traffic lanes, frequently in conjunction with raised reflective markers. Botts' dots are also used across a travel lane to draw the drivers attention to the road. They are frequently used in this way to alert drivers to toll booths, school zones or other significant reduction of speed limit. They are normally only used in warm climates since snow plows usually remove them along with the snow.\nRumble strips are commonly used for the same purpose. A rumble strip can be a series of simple troughs, typically 1 cm (0.4 in) deep and 10 cm (4 in) wide, that is ground out of the asphalt. Other alternatives, similar to the Botts' dots, use raised strips, painted or glued to the surface. A specific form of raised strips using thermoplastic is called profile thermoplastic markings. The markings are created by fusing thermoplastic to the pavement and create alternating elevation and recession pattern. This can be done as inverted-profile markings or raised-profile markings. Inverted-profile markings are created by pressing a cog rolling over the markings while they are wet to make them corrugated. Raised-profile markings are created by extruding extra thickness of thermoplastic at a specific interval "")","('metadata', {'title': 'Road surface marking', 'summary': 'Road surface marking is any kind of device or material that is used on a road surface in order to convey official information; they are commonly placed with road marking machines (also referred to as road marking equipment or pavement marking equipment).

"('page_content', ""An accident is an unintended, normally unwanted event that was not directly caused by humans.  The term accident implies that nobody should be blamed, but the event may have been caused by unrecognized or unaddressed risks.  Most researchers who study unintentional injury avoid using the term accident and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.  For example, when a tree falls down during a wind storm, its fall may not have been caused by humans, but the tree's type, size, health, location, or improper maintenance may have contributed to the result. Most car wrecks are not true accidents; however, English speakers started using that word in the mid-20th century as a result of media manipulation by the US automobile industry.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Physical and non-physical ===\nPhysical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions, tongue biting while eating, electric shock by accidentally touching bare electric wire, drowning, falls, being injured by touching something sharp or hot, or bumping into something while walking. \nNon-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a secret or otherwise saying something incorrectly, accidental deletion of data, or forgetting an appointment.\n\n\n=== Accidents by activity ===\nAccidents during the execution of work or arising out of it are called work accidents. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than 337 million accidents happen on the job each year, resulting, together with occupational diseases, in more than 2.3 million deaths annually.\nIn contrast, leisure-related accidents are mainly sports injuries.\n\n\n=== Accidents by vehicle ===\n\nIt has been argued by some critics that vehicle collisions are not truly accidents, given that they are mostly caused by preventable causes such as drunk driving and intentionally driving too fast, and as such should not be referred to as accidents. Since 1994, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked media and the public to not use the word accident to describe vehicle collisions.\n\n\n==== Aviation accidents and incidents ====\n\n\n==== Bicycle accidents ====\n\n\n==== Maritime incidents ====\n\n\n==== Traffic collisions ====\n\n\n==== Train wrecks ====\n\n\n=== Domino effect accidents ===\nIn the process industry, a primary accident may propagate to nearby units, resulting in a chain of accidents, which is called domino effect accident.\n\n\n== Common causes ==\n\nPoisons, vehicle collisions and falls are the most common causes of fatal injuries. According to a 2005 survey of injuries sustained at home, which used data from the National Vital Statistics System of the United States National Center for Health Statistics, falls, poisoning, and fire/burn injuries are the most common causes of death.\nThe United States also collects statistically valid injury data (sampled from 100 hospitals) through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System administered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This program was revised in 2000 to include all injuries rather than just injuries involving products. Data on emergency department visits is also collected through the National Health Interview Survey.

The term accident implies that nobody should be blamed, but the event may have been caused by unrecognized or unaddressed risks.  Most researchers who study unintentional injury avoid using the term accident and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.  For example, when a tree falls down during a wind storm, its fall may not have been caused by humans, but the tree's type, size, health, location, or improper maintenance may have contributed to the result.

"('page_content', 'First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person with either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery until medical services arrive. First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical training. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health, while psychological first aid is used as early treatment of people who are at risk for developing PTSD. Conflict first aid, focused on preservation and recovery of an individual\'s social or relationship well-being, is being piloted in Canada.\nThere are many situations that may require first aid, and many countries have legislation, regulation, or guidance, which specifies a minimum level of first aid provision in certain circumstances.

The bandaging of battle wounds is shown on Classical Greek pottery from c.\u2009500 BC, whilst the parable of the Good Samaritan includes references to binding or dressing wounds.  There are numerous references to first aid performed within the Roman army, with a system of first aid supported by surgeons, field ambulances, and hospitals.  Roman legions had the specific role of capsarii, who were responsible for first aid such as bandaging, and are the forerunners of the modern combat medic.\nFurther examples occur through history, still mostly related to battle, with examples such as the Knights Hospitaller in the 11th century AD, providing care to pilgrims and knights in the Holy Land.\n\n\n=== Formalization of life saving treatments ===\nDuring the late 18th century, drowning as a cause of death was a major concern amongst the population. In 1767, a society for the preservation of life from accidents in water was started in Amsterdam, and in 1773, physician William Hawes began publicizing the power of artificial respiration as means of resuscitation of those who appeared drowned. This led to the formation, in 1774, of the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned, later the Royal Humane Society, who did much to promote resuscitation.\nNapoleon\'s surgeon, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, is credited with creating an ambulance corps, the ambulance volantes, which included medical assistants, tasked to administer first aid in battle.\nIn 1859, Swiss businessman Jean-Henri Dunant witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino, and his work led to the formation of the Red Cross, with a key stated aim of ""aid to sick and wounded soldiers in the field"". The Red Cross and Red Crescent are still the largest provider of first aid worldwide.\n\nIn 1870, Prussian military surgeon Friedrich von Esmarch introduced formalized first aid to the military, and first coined the term ""erste hilfe"" (translating to \'first aid\'), including training for soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War on care for wounded comrades using pre-learnt bandaging and splinting skills, and making use of the Esmarch bandage which he design')","('metadata', {'title': 'First aid', 'summary': ""First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person with either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery until medical services arrive.

"('page_content', 'Driving under the influence (DUI) is the offense of driving, operating, or being in control of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs (including recreational drugs and those prescribed by physicians), to a level that renders the driver incapable of operating a motor vehicle safely. Multiple other terms are used for the offense in various jurisdictions.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe name of the offense varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from legal to colloquial terminology. In various jurisdictions the offense is termed ""driving under the influence"" [of alcohol or other drugs] (DUI), ""driving under the influence of intoxicants"" (DUII), ""driving while impaired"" (DWI), ""impaired driving"", ""driving while intoxicated"" (DWI), ""impaired driving"", ""operating while intoxicated"" (OWI), ""operating under the influence"" (OUI), ""operating [a] vehicle under the influence"" (OVI), ""drunk in charge"", or ""over the prescribed limit"" (in the UK). Alcohol-related DUI is referred to as ""drunk driving"", ""drunken driving"", or ""drinking and driving"" (US), or ""drink-driving"" (UK/Ireland/Australia). Cannabis-related DUI may be termed ""driving high"", and more generally drug-related DUI may be referred to as ""drugged driving"", ""driving under the influence of drugs"" (DUID), or ""drug impaired driving"".\nIn the United States, the specific criminal offense is usually called driving under the influence, but states may use other names for the offense including ""driving while intoxicated"" (DWI), ""operating while impaired"" (OWI) or ""operating while ability impaired"", and ""operating a vehicle under the influence"" (OVI).\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe criminal offense may not involve actual driving of the vehicle, but rather may broadly include being physically ""in control"" of a car while intoxicated, even if the person charged is not in the act of driving. For example, individuals found in the driver\'s seat of a car while intoxicated and holding the car keys, even while parked, may be charged with DUI in the majority of U.S. states because they are in control of the vehicle.\nIn construing the terms DUI, DWI, OWI, and OVI, a few states[which?] such as California therefore make it illegal to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence or driving while intoxicated while the others all indicate that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence. Virtually all of the states permit enforcement of DUI/DWI and OWI/OVI statutes based on ""operation and control"" of a vehicle, while California and a few others[which?]  require actual ""driving"". ""The distinction between these two terms is material, for it is generally held that the word \'drive,\' as used in statutes of this kind, usually denotes movement of the vehicle in some direction, whereas the word \'operate\' has a broader meaning so as to include not only the motion of the vehicle but also acts which engage the machinery of the vehicle that, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle."" (State v. Graves (1977) 269 S.C. 356 [237 S.E.2d 584, 586–588, 586. fn. 8].)\nMerriam Webster\'s Dictionary defines DUI (in the United States) as ""1. the act or crime of driving a vehicle while affected by alcohol or drugs; 2. an arrest or conviction for driving under the influence; 3. a person who is arrested for or convicted of driving under the influence.""\nMany DUI laws apply also to motorcycling, boating, piloting aircraft, use of mobile farm machinery such as tractors and combines, riding horses or driving a horse-drawn vehicle, bicycling, or skateboarding, possibly with different BAC level than driving. In some jurisdictions, there are separate charges depending on the vehicle used. In Washington state, for instance, BUI (bicycling under the influence) laws recognize that intoxicated cyclists are likely to primarily endanger themselves. Accordingly, law enforcement officers are empowered only to protect the cyclist by impounding the bicycle rather than filing DUI charges.\nGeorge Smi')","('metadata', {'title': 'Driving under the influence', 'summary': 'Driving under the influence (DUI) is the offense of driving, operating, or being in control of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs (including recreational drugs and those prescribed by physicians), to a level that renders the driver incapable of operating a motor vehicle safely.

It is located \nbehind the breastbone (sternum) and between the lungs. The heart’s muscles are \nstimulated by tiny electrical impulses generated by a network of specialised tissue.\nCardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating. Not all causes of sudden cardiac \narrest are known. One common cause is myocardial infarction (heart attack) \nwhich is when the heart’s own arteries become blocked. Apart from not supplying \nthe body with oxygenated blood, the heart muscle itself is starved of oxygen and \nbecomes damaged so does not respond properly to the natural electrical signals:\n\th The electrical impulses may no longer cause rhythmical pumping and the \nmuscle contractions become uncoordinated\n\th The muscle may quiver or tremble, due to chaotic impulses\n\th The heart stops pumping.\nThe unrhythmical and chaotic attempts to beat are called arrhythmia. There \nare several forms of arrhythmia, and not all of them are shockable with an AED. \nHowever, the most common type, which occurs in about 80% of cardiac arrests, is \nshockable. This is called ventricular fibrillation (VF). If treated quickly, VF may be \nconverted back to a working rhythm.\nAn AED should be applied to a casualty with a suspected heart attack who is \nunresponsive and not breathing normally.\nIt is a good idea to familiarise yourself with the AED you are likely to use as this can \nsave vital seconds in an emergency.\nProcedure\nThis procedure is for children and adults: an AED should not be used on a baby. A \nchild can be defibrillated if paediatric pads are available for the AED.\nWhen you arrive at the scene, quickly establish:\n\th where the casualty is in the chain of survival\n\th what, if any, emergency first aid has been administered.\nUsing an AED\n1.

They should \ncontinue to perform CPR even as you attach the pads to the casualty’s chest, \nonly stopping when you reach step 8\n4. Position the AED beside the casualty, ideally to their left as this makes the pad \nplacement easier and means you don’t need to reach over the casualty.

If the casualty has very hairy skin use the disposable razor or scissors in the \nAED pack to remove excess hair from the pad sites\n4. Each pad has a clear visual instruction showing where to place it. One pad goes \non the right side of the casualty’s upper chest, directly under their collar bone. \nThe other one is placed on the left side of the casualty’s chest, about 10cm \nbelow their armpit. If the casualty has a pacemaker fitted, the pads must be \nplaced 12–15cm from it. An implanted pacemaker appears as a bump under the \nskin. It is usually under the armpit and can be felt with your fingers\n5. Apply the pads using a sweeping motion while smoothing the edges in place by \nrunning your fingers around them\n6. If the AED tells you to check the pads, or if they become loose, smooth them in \nplace with your fingers. If this does not help, apply a new set of pads\n7.

There are some injuries, such as broken bones, where \na bruise can be an indication of something more serious.\nInternal bleeding may happen as the result of an injury or because of a medical \ncondition like a stomach ulcer bursting. You should always consider the risk of a \ncasualty having internal bleeding, especially if they display the symptoms of shock \nwithout any obvious fluid loss.\nAll bleeding must be taken seriously as uncontrolled severe bleeding can lead to \nshock, collapse and even death. Controlling the bleeding is always your priority.\nFor details of the symptoms of shock and how to treat it, see page 46.\nMinor bleeding\nTreatment\nAims - To clean the wound and reduce the risk of infection.\n1. If it is dirty, clean the wound under running water or with an alcohol-free wipe. \nPat the wound dry using sterile materials, like a gauze swab\n2. Cover the wound completely with a sterile material, such as a gauze square or \ndressing\n3. If possible, elevate and support the injured area above heart level\n4.

Splinters can be easily removed from the skin using tweezers. However, \nif the splinter is deep in the skin it can be difficult to remove and should be left in \nplace. Advise the casualty to seek medical help. \n1. Clean the area around the splinter carefully with warm water and soap. \n2. Grasp the splinter with the tweezers as close to the skin as possible and draw it \nout in a straight line keeping it at the same angle as it goes into the skin. \n3.

"('page_content', 'Foreword\nEvery day thousands of people are killed and \ninjured on our roads. Men, women or children \nwalking, biking or riding to school or work, \nplaying in the streets or setting out on long trips, \nwill never return home, leaving behind shattered \nfamilies and communities. Millions of people each \nyear will spend long weeks in hospital after severe \ncrashes and many will never be able to live, work or play as they used to do. Current efforts to address road \nsafety are minimal in comparison to this growing human suffering.\n The World Health Organization and the World Bank have jointly produced this World report on road trafﬁc injury \nprevention . Its purpose is to present a comprehensive overview of what is known about the magnitude, risk fac -\ntors and impact of road trafﬁc injuries, and about ways to prevent and lessen the impact of road crashes. The \ndocument is the outcome of a collaborative effort by institutions and individuals. Coordinated by the World \nHealth Organization and the World Bank, over 100 experts, from all continents and different sectors – includ -\ning transport, engineering, health, police, education and civil society – have worked to produce the report. \n Road trafﬁc injuries are a growing public health issue, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups \nof road users, including the poor. More than half the people killed in trafﬁc crashes are young adults aged \nbetween 15 and 44 years – often the breadwinners in a family. Furthermore, road trafﬁc injuries cost low-\nincome and middle-income countries between 1% and 2% of their gross national product – more than the \ntotal development aid received by these countries.\n But road trafﬁc crashes and injuries are preventable. In high-income countries, an established set of inter -\nventions have contributed to signiﬁcant reductions in the incidence and impact of road trafﬁc injuries. These \ninclude the enforcement of legislation to control speed and alcohol consumption, mandating the use of seat -\nbelts and crash helmets, and the safer design and use of roads and vehicles. Reduction in road trafﬁc injuries \ncan contribute to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals that aim to halve extreme poverty and \nsigniﬁcantly reduce child mortality. \n Road trafﬁc injury prevention must be incorporated into a broad range of activities, such as the develop -\nment and management of road infrastructure, the provision of safer vehicles, law enforcement, mobility \nplanning, the provision of health and hospital services, child welfare services, and urban and environmental \nplanning. The health sector is an important partner in this process. Its roles are to strengthen the evidence \nbase, provide appropriate pre-hospital and hospital care and rehabilitation, conduct advocacy, and contribute \nto the implementation and evaluation of interventions.\n The time to act is now. Road safety is no accident. It requires strong political will and concerted, sustained \nefforts across a range of sectors. Acting now will save lives. We urge governments, as well as other sectors of \nsociety, to embrace and implement the key recommendations of this report.\n LEE Jong-wook James D Wolfensohn\n Director-General  President\n World Health Organization  World Bank Group\nPhoto: © WHO, P.

The Kenyan government appreciates that road trafﬁc injuries are a major public health problem \namenable to prevention.\n In 2003, the newly formed Government of the National Alliance Rainbow Coalition, took up the road \nsafety challenge. It is focusing on speciﬁc measures to curtail the prevalent disregard of trafﬁc regulations \nand mandating speed limiters in public service vehicles.\n Along with the above measures the Government has also launched a six-month Road Safety Campaign \nand declared war on corruption, which contributes directly and indirectly to the country’s unacceptably \nhigh levels of road trafﬁc accidents.\n I urge all nations to implement the recommendations of the World report on road trafﬁc injury prevention as a \nguide to promoting road safety in their countries. With this tool in hand, I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues in health, transport, education and other sectors to more fully address this major public \nhealth problem.\nMwai Kibaki, President, Republic of Kenya\nIn 2004, World Health Day, organized by the World Health Organization, will for the ﬁrst time be devoted \nto Road Safety. Every year, according to the statistics, 1.2 million people are known to die in road accidents \nworldwide. Millions of others sustain injuries, with some suffering permanent disabilities. No country \nis spared this toll in lives and suffering, which strikes the young particularly. Enormous human potential \nis being destroyed, with also grave social and economic consequences. Road safety is thus a major public \nhealth issue throughout the world.\n World Health Day will be ofﬁcially launched in Paris on 7 April 2004. France is honoured. It sees this as \nrecognition of the major efforts made by the French population as a whole, which mobilized to reduce the \ndeath and destruction it faces on the roads. These efforts will only achieve results if they are supported by \na genuine refusal to accept road accidents fatalistically and a determination to overcome all-too-frequent \nindifference and resignation. The mobilization of the French Government and the relevant institutions, \nparticularly civic organizations, together with a strong accident prevention and monitoring policy, reduced \ntrafﬁc fatalities in France by 20%, from 7242 in 2002 to 5732 in 2003. Much remains to be done, but one \nthing is already clear : it is by changing mentalities that we will, together, manage to win this collective \nand individual struggle for life.\nJacques Chirac, President, France')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 10})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'x • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nGlobally deaths and injuries resulting from road trafﬁc crashes are a major and growing public health \nproblem. Viet Nam has not been spared. In the year 2002, the global mortality rate due to trafﬁc accidents \nwas 19 per 100 000 population while in Viet Nam the ﬁgure was 27 per 100 000 population. Road trafﬁc \ncollisions on the nation’s roads claim ﬁve times more lives now than they did ten years ago. In 2003 a total \nof 20 774 incidents were reported, leading to 12 864 deaths, 20 704 injuries and thousands of billions of \nViet Nam Dong in costs.\n A main contributor to road crashes in Viet Nam is the rapid increase in the number of vehicles, particu -\nlarly motorcycles, which increase by 10% every year. Nearly half of the motorcycle riders are not licensed, \nand three quarters don’t comply with trafﬁc laws. Also, the development of roads and other transport \ninfrastructure has not been able to keep pace with rapid economic growth.\n To reduce deaths and injuries, protect property and contribute to sustainable development, the Govern -\nment of Viet Nam established the National Committee on Trafﬁc Safety in 1995. In 2001 the Government \npromulgated the National Policy on Accidents and Injury Prevention with the target of reducing trafﬁc \ndeaths to 9 per 10 000 vehicles. Government initiatives to reduce trafﬁc accidents include issuing new \ntrafﬁc regulations and strengthening trafﬁc law enforcement. In 2003, the number of trafﬁc accidents was \nreduced by 27.2% over the previous year, while the deaths and injury rates declined by 8.1% and 34.8% \nrespectively. \n The Government of Viet Nam will implement more stringent measures to reduce road trafﬁc injuries \nthrough health promotion campaigns, consolidation of the injury surveillance system, and mobilization \nof various sectors at all levels and the whole society. The Government of Viet Nam welcomes the World \nHealth Organization/World Bank World report on road trafﬁc injury prevention, and is committed to implementing \nits recommendations to the fullest extent possible.\nH.E. Mr Phan Van Khai, Prime Minister, Socialist Republic of Viet Nam\nIn Thailand road accidents are considered one of the top three public health problems in the country. \nDespite the Government’s best efforts, there are sadly over 13 000 deaths and more than one million \ninjuries each year as the result of road accidents, with several hundred thousand people disabled. An over -\nwhelming majority of the deaths and injuries involve motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians.\n The Royal Thai Government regards this problem to be of great urgency and has accorded it high prior -\nity in the national agenda. We are also aware of the fact that effective and sustainable prevention of such \ninjuries can only be achieved through concerted multisectoral collaboration.\n To deal with this crucial problem, the Government has established a Road Safety Operations Centre \nencompassing the different sectors of the country and comprising the government agencies concerned, non -\ngovernmental organizations and civil society. The Centre has undertaken many injury prevention initiatives, \nincluding a “Don’t Drink and Drive” campaign as well as a campaign to encourage motorcyclists to wear \nsafety helmets and to engage in safe driving practices. In this regard, we are well aware that such a campaign \nmust involve not only public relations and education but also stringent law enforcement measures.\n The problem of road trafﬁc injuries is indeed a highly serious one, but it is also a problem that can be \ndealt with and prevented through concerted action among all the parties concerned. Through the leader -\nship and strong commitment of the Government, we are conﬁdent that we will be successful in our efforts \nand we hope that others will be as well.\nThaksin Shinawatra, Prime Minister, Thailand')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 11})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'PREFACE  • xi\nWe are pleased that the Sultanate of Oman, with other countries, has brought up the issue of road safety to \nthe United Nations General Assembly and played a major role in raising global awareness to the growing \nimpact of deadly road trafﬁc injuries, especially in the developing world.\n The magnitude of the problem, encouraged the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a special \nresolution (No 58/9), and the World Health Organization to declare the year 2004 as the year of road \nsafety.\n In taking these two important steps, both organizations started the world battle against trauma caused \nby road accidents, and we hope that all sectors of our societies will cooperate to achieve this noble humani -\ntarian objective.\n The world report on road trafﬁc injury prevention  is no doubt a compelling reading document. We congratulate the \nWorld Health Organization and the World Bank for producing such a magniﬁcent presentation.\n Qaboos bin Said, Sultan of Oman\nLand transportation systems have become a crucial component of modernity. By speeding up communica -\ntions and the transport of goods and people, they have generated a revolution in contemporary economic \nand social relations.\n However, incorporating new technology has not come about without cost: environmental contamina -\ntion, urban stress and deteriorating air quality are directly linked to modern land transport systems. Above \nall, transportation is increasingly associated with the rise in road accidents and premature deaths, as well \nas physical and psychological handicaps. Losses are not limited to reduced worker productivity and trauma \naffecting a victim’s private life. Equally signiﬁcant are the rising costs in health services and the added bur -\nden on public ﬁnances.\n In developing countries the situation is made worse by rapid and unplanned urbanization. The absence \nof adequate infrastructure in our cities, together with the lack of a legal regulatory framework, make the \nexponential rise in the number of road accidents all the more worrying. The statistics show that in Brazil, \n30 000 people die every year in road accidents. Of these, 44% are between 20 and 39 years of age, and  \n82% are men.\n As in other Latin American countries, there is a growing awareness in Brazil as to the urgency of revers -\ning this trend. The Brazilian Government, through the Ministry of Cities, has put considerable effort into \ndeveloping and implementing road security, education campaigns and programmes that emphasize citizen \ninvolvement. As part of this endeavour Brazil recently adopted a new road trafﬁc code that has brought \ndown the annual number of road deaths by about 5000. This is a welcome development that should spur \nus to even further progress. The challenges are enormous and must not be side stepped. This is why road \nsecurity will remain a priority for my Government.\n The publication of this report is therefore extremely timely. The data and analysis that it brings to light \nwill provide valuable material for a systematic and in-depth debate on an issue that affects the health of \nall. Of even greater signiﬁcance is the fact that the report will help reinforce our conviction that adequate \npreventive measures can have a dramatic impact. The decision to dedicate the 2004 World Health Day to \nRoad Safety points to the international community’s determination to ensure that modern means of land \ntransportation are increasingly a force for development and the well-being of our peoples.\nLuis Inácio Lula da Silva, President, Federative Republic of Brazil')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 12})","('type', 'Document')"

The World Health Organization (WHO) has \nbeen concerned with this issue for over four decades. As early as 1962, a WHO report discussed the nature \nand dynamics of the problem ( 1). In 1974, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA27.59, \ndeclaring road trafﬁc accidents a major public health issue and calling for Member States to address the \nproblem ( 2). For the past two decades, the World Bank has encouraged its borrowers to include road safety \ncomponents within most of their highway and urban transport projects. \n Over the last three years, both organizations have intensiﬁed their work in road trafﬁc injury preven -\ntion. This was reﬂected in the establishment in March 2000 of WHO’s Department of Injuries and Violence \nPrevention, the development and implementation of a ﬁve-year WHO strategy for road trafﬁc injury pre -\nvention, and greater ﬁnancial and human support for road trafﬁc injury prevention activities around the \nworld ( 3). Recently, WHO dedicated World Health Day for 2004 to Road Safety. Within the World Bank, \nan interdisciplinary task force was established to ensure that this important issue was regarded as a major \npublic health issue and tackled jointly by transport and public health specialists. \n Among other international organizations, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the \nUnited Nations Development Fund and the United Nations Children’s Fund, have all stepped up their road \nsafety activities over the past decade. In early 2003, the United Nations adopted Resolution (A/RES/57/309) \non the global road safety crisis ( 4), followed by a report of the Secretary-General on the same topic to the \n58th session of the United Nations General Assembly later that year ( 5). In November 2003, a further Reso -\nlution (A/RES/58/9) was passed by the United Nations, calling for a plenary meeting of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly on 14 April 2004. The purpose of the plenary meeting would be to increase awareness of \nthe magnitude of the road injury problem, and to discuss the implementation of the World report on road trafﬁc \ninjury prevention at the United Nations General Assembly ( 6).\n This joint WHO/World Bank report on road trafﬁc injury prevention is an important part of the response \nto the world’s road safety crisis. It is directed at international, regional and national policy-makers, interna -\ntional agencies and key professionals in public health, transport, engineering, education and other sectors, and \naims to stimulate action for road safety. It sets out universal principles rather than a “blue print” for worldwide \napplication, recognizing fully the need to identify local needs and the adaptation of “best practices” accord -\ningly. A summary of the report is also available at http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention.\nAims of the report\nThe central theme of this report is the burden of road trafﬁc injuries and the urgent need for governments \nand other key players to increase and sustain action to prevent road trafﬁc injury.\n The report’s goals are:\n— to raise awareness about the magnitude, risk factors and impacts of road trafﬁc collisions globally;\n— to draw attention to the preventability of the problem and present known intervention strategies; ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 20})","('type', 'Document')"

"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 1.  THE FUNDAMENTALS  • 3\nIntroduction\nRoad trafﬁc injuries are a major but neglected global \npublic health problem, requiring concerted efforts \nfor effective and sustainable prevention. Of all the \nsystems that people have to deal with on a daily \nbasis, road transport is the most complex and the \nmost dangerous. Worldwide, the number of people \nkilled in road trafﬁc crashes each year is estimated \nat almost 1.2 million, while the number injured \ncould be as high as 50 million – the combined \npopulation of ﬁve of the world’s large cities. The \ntragedy behind these ﬁgures regularly attracts less \nmedia attention than other, less frequent but more \nunusual types of tragedy.\n What is worse, without increased efforts and new \ninitiatives, the total number of road trafﬁc deaths \nworldwide and injuries is forecast to rise by some \n65% between 2000 and 2020 ( 1, 2), and in low-\nincome and middle-income countries deaths are \nexpected to increase by as much as 80%. The majority \nof such deaths are currently among “vulnerable road \nusers” – pedestrians, pedal cyclists and motorcyclists. \nIn high-income countries, deaths among car occu -\npants continue to be predominant, but the risks per \ncapita that vulnerable road users face are high.\n This is the ﬁrst major report on road injury pre -\nvention jointly issued by the World Health Organi -\nzation (WHO) and the World Bank, and under -\nscores the concern that the two bodies share about \nthe detrimental impact of an unsafe road transport \nsystem on public health and global development. It \nis the contention of the report, ﬁrst, that the level of \nroad deaths and injuries is unacceptable, and sec -\nond, that it is to a large extent avoidable.\n There is thus an urgent need to recognize the \nworsening situation in road deaths and injuries \nand to take appropriate action. Road trafﬁc injury \nprevention and mitigation should be given the same \nattention and scale of resources that is currently \npaid to other prominent health issues if increasing \nhuman loss and injury on the roads, with their dev -\nastating human impact and large economic cost to \nsociety, are to be averted.\n The report has three main aims:\n• To create a greater level of awareness, com -\nmitment and informed decision-making at all levels – including among governments, \nprofessional sectors and international agencies \n– so that strategies scientiﬁcally proven to be \neffective in preventing road injuries can be \nimplemented. Any effective response to the \nglobal challenge of reducing trafﬁc casualties \nwill necessarily require a large mobilization \nof effort by all those concerned, at the inter -\nnational, national and local levels.\n• To provide a sound justiﬁcation for the change \nin thinking that has taken place in recent years, \nespecially where signiﬁcant research has been \nundertaken, about the nature of the road trafﬁc \ninjury problem and what constitutes successful \nprevention. The perception that it is the price \nto be paid for achieving mobility and economic \ndevelopment, needs to be replaced by a more \nholistic ideology that places the emphasis on \nthe total system of road trafﬁc.\n• To help strengthen institutions and create \neffective partnerships to deliver safer road \ntrafﬁc systems. Such partnerships should \nexist horizontally between different sectors of \ngovernment  and vertically between different \nlevels of government, as well as between gov -\nernments and nongovernmental organizations. \nAt governmental level this means establishing \na close collaboration between the sectors of \ntransport, public health, ﬁnance, the judiciary \nand others concerned.\n The report is thus principally aimed at policy-\nmakers and key professionals in all sectors and at \nall levels, with an objective to provide a strategic \nframework for action. Universal principles are set \nout, rather than a single action plan with worldwide \napplicability. This is because local conditions must \nalways be taken into account, so that best practices \nproven elsewhere can be reﬁned and adapted into \nrelevant and successful local interventions.\nA public health concern\nRoad deaths, disability and injury\nEvery day around the world, almost 16 000 people \ndie from all types of injuries.

"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 1.  THE FUNDAMENTALS  • 5\n In low-income countries and \nregions – in Africa, Asia, the \nCaribbean and Latin America \n– the majority of road deaths are \namong pedestrians, passengers, \ncyclists, users of motorized two-\nwheelers, and occupants of buses \nand minibuses ( 7, 8). The leading \ncasualties in most high-income \ncountries, on the other hand, are \namong the occupants of cars.\n However, when it comes to \ncomparative fatality rates (deaths \nfor any measure of exposure) \nfor all users in the trafﬁc system, \nthese regional differences disap -\npear. Nearly everywhere, the risk \nof dying in a road crash is far higher for vulnerable \nroad users – pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists \n– than for car occupants ( 8, 9).\n The road trafﬁc death toll represents only the \n“tip of the iceberg” of the total waste of human and \nsocietal resources from road injuries. WHO esti -\nmates that, worldwide, between 20 million and 50 \nmillion people are injured or disabled each year in \nroad trafﬁc crashes (the reason for the wide range \nof this estimate being the considerable, known \nunderreporting of casualties) ( 10).\n Using epidemiological evidence from national \nstudies, a conservative estimate can be obtained of \nthe ratios between road deaths, injuries requiring \nhospital treatment, and minor injuries, as being  \n1:15:70 in most countries ( 11–18 ).\n In many low-income and middle-income coun -\ntries, the burden of trafﬁc-related injuries is such \nthat they represent between 30% and 86% of all \ntrauma admissions ( 19, 20 ).\n While a decrease in deaths due to road trafﬁc \ncrashes of some 30% is forecast in high-income \ncountries, current and projected trends in low-\nincome and middle-income countries foreshadow \na huge escalation in global road crash mortality \nbetween 2000 and 2020. Furthermore, on current \ntrends, by 2020, road crash injury is likely to be the \nthird leading cause of disability-adjusted life years \nlost (see Table 1.2).The social and economic costs of road \ntrafﬁc injuries\nIn economic terms, the cost of road crash injuries is \nestimated at roughly 1% of gross national product \n(GNP) in low-income countries, 1.5% in middle-\nincome countries and 2% in high-income countries \n(5).\n The direct economic costs of global road crashes \nhave been estimated at US$ 518 billion, with the \ncosts in low-income countries – estimated at US$ 65 \nbillion – exceeding the total annual amount received \nin development assistance ( 5). Furthermore, the \ncosts estimated for low-income and middle-income \ncountries are probably signiﬁcant underestimates. \nUsing more comprehensive data and measurement \ntechniques, the estimated annual costs (both direct \nand indirect) of road crash injury in European \nUnion (EU) countries alone, which contribute 5% to \nthe global death toll, exceed €180 billion (US$ 207 \nbillion) ( 9, 21). For the United States of America, the \nhuman capital costs of road trafﬁc crashes in 2000 \nwere estimated at US$ 230 billion ( 22). If compara -\nble estimates were made of the direct and indirect \neconomic costs of road crashes in low-income and \nmiddle-income countries, the total economic cost \nglobally of road crashes would be likely to exceed \nthe current estimate of US$ 518 billion.\n Road crashes not only place a heavy burden \non national and regional economies but also on TABLE 1.2\nChange in rank order of DALYs for the 10 leading causes of the global \nburden of disease\n1990 2020\nRank Disease or injury Rank Disease or injury\n1 Lower respiratory infections 1 Ischaemic heart disease\n2 Diarrhoeal diseases 2 Unipolar major depression\n3 Perinatal conditions 3 Road trafﬁc injuries\n4 Unipolar major depression 4 Cerebrovascular disease\n5 Ischaemic heart disease 5 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n6 Cerebrovascular disease 6 Lower respiratory infections\n7 Tuberculosis 7 Tuberculosis\n8 Measles 8 War\n9 Road trafﬁc injuries 9 Diarrhoeal diseases\n10 Congenital abnormalities 10 HIV\nDALY: Disability-adjusted life year.

In Kenya, for example, \nmore than 75% of road trafﬁc casualties are among \neconomically productive young adults ( 23). \n Despite the large social and economic costs, \nthough, there has been a relatively small amount \nof investment in road safety research and develop -\nment, compared with other types of health loss \n(see Table 1.3).\n There exist, however, well-tested, cost-effective and publicly-acceptable solutions to the problem. \nFunding for interventions, though, even in many \ncountries most active in road safety – all of whom \nhave targets for further reductions in casualties \n– has been scarce ( 25–28 ).\n In short, current road safety efforts fail to match \nthe severity of the problem. Road travel brings \nsociety beneﬁts, but the price society is paying for \nit is very high.\nBOX 1.1\nThe human tragedies behind road crash statistics\nOn a spring weekend in 2000, in the rural English setting of Suffolk, Ruth, 22 years old and her brother Paul, 20, \njoined their parents to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. After the family celebrations, on the Sunday \nevening, Paul went to a ﬁlm, driven by a friend in his amateurly-repaired and rebuilt old Fiat Uno.\n At midnight they heard the heavy knocking of a policeman, who announced that there had been a car crash and \nasked the shocked parents to attend the local hospital. The prognosis was terrible. Paul had suffered massive brain \ninjury and was not expected to live. Strangely, he did not look so bad – many scratches and bruises, deep glass cuts \nto his left cheek, and broken ﬁngers and femur – but the brain scan told a far worse story.\n Paul was transferred to intensive care and, within hours, to the regional Neurosciences Critical Care Unit. \nMercifully, they had a bed and knew how to provide the best care. However, his life hung by a thread. He had \nsuffered severe injuries to his brain and lungs. The doctors kept Paul in a coma until he had stabilized. When he was \nallowed to come round, though, the family’s worst fears were conﬁrmed as the doctors talked about nerves severed \nfrom the brain stem.\n Paul survived and now, over three years later, continues to progress, but painfully slowly, from a minimally-\nresponsive, vegetative state. He still cannot walk or talk or write, so communication with him is very difﬁcult. But \nhe can now smile, and show pleasure or frustration. He can swallow and eat and, with the coordination in his right \nhand improving and with prompting, he can sometimes help himself to eat. He remains doubly-incontinent.\n After a few months in a general hospital, Paul had six months of rehabilitation therapy and is now in a high-\ndependency home, 50 km from his parents. Additional therapy, support workers and equipment are paid for from \ninterim compensation claims against the driver’s insurance. Without these funds, and the tireless lobbying and much \nother work by his parents, his sister and others, Paul would not have progressed as far as he has.\n Mum and Dad go to see Paul once a week, often timing the visit to coincide with discussions with doctors, managers \nor therapists. They bring Paul home most Saturdays and once a month overnight. Dad can only work three days a week \nnow because of the load of duties related to Paul. Their house has been adapted to accommodate the wheelchair and \nprovide for Paul’s care needs.\n The family has learnt to cope with the stress caused by the memory of the crash and its consequences. However, \ntheir trust and their attitude of “it won’t happen to me or my close ones” has disappeared. Instead, there is agonized \nconcern about road safety, the attitudes of drivers and the injustices of the legal system.\n In this case, the young driver had driven so fast that, trying to take a corner, he caught the kerb, crossed the road, \nclimbed a low bank and crashed the rear of the car into a tree. Paul was in the back and took the brunt of the impact. \nThe back of the car broke off, due to the poor-quality “renovation” job on the rusted vehicle, which should never \nhave been allowed to pass the compulsory annual vehicle test (the “MOT” test).\n The system failed Paul’s family by doing nothing about the dishonest MOT pass, and by bringing only a minor \ndriving charge against the driver, with the offence of excess speed – and not of ruining Paul’s life. On top of their \nsuffering, Paul’s parents have had to live with the injustices of the law, which they feel does not deal properly with \ncrashes such as those of Paul, and pays inadequate attention to serious injury.\n There can be a very ﬁne dividing line between death and injury. For many months, the family grieved over the loss \nof Paul, who had before him all the hopes of a bright and promising young man – hopes that have long vanished.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 29})","('type', 'Document')"

THE FUNDAMENTALS  • 7\nChanging fundamental  \nperceptions\nA key purpose of this report is to communicate \ncurrent knowledge and thinking about road injury \nprevention to a wider audience involved in manag -\ning road safety. Since the last major WHO world \nreport on road safety issued over 40 years ago ( 29), \nthere has been a major change in the perception, \nunderstanding and practice of road injury preven -\ntion – a shift of paradigms – among trafﬁc safety \nprofessionals around the world.\n Figure 1.1 sets out the guiding principles of this \nparadigm. Some governments, some organizations, \nand some individuals will more easily and readily \nthan others take on board their implications. The \nprinciples involved will not all be adopted at once \nbut will take time to become ﬁrmly established, \neven in those countries where road safety is ener -\ngetically pursued.\n The following sections provide examples of \nhow this new way of perceiving and dealing with \nroad trafﬁc safety is already affecting capacity  \nbuilding and policy. Also discussed are the types \nof measures found to be successful and the starting \npoints for institutional and programme develop -\nment. Chapter 4 examines further some of the pro -\ngrammes and interventions for road trafﬁc safety \nthat are suitable for local adoption and adaptation.\nThe predictability and preventability of \nroad crash injury\nOne reason for the historical neglect of “injury” \nin public health is the traditional view of acci -\ndents and injuries as random events that happen to others ( 6, 30). Such events are looked upon as \nan inevitable outcome of road transport.\n While the risk of a crash is relatively low for \nmost individual journeys, people travel many \ntimes each day, every week and every year. The \nsum of these small risks is considerable. The term \n“accident”, which is widely used, can give the \nimpression, probably unintended, of inevitabil -\nity and unpredictability – an event that cannot be \nmanaged. This document prefers to use the term \n“crash” instead, to denote something that is an \nevent, or series of events, amenable to rational \nanalysis and remedial action.\n Many highly-motorized countries, in response \nto rising road trauma levels during the 1960s and \nearly 1970s, achieved large reductions in casual -\nties through outcome-oriented and science-based \napproaches. This response was stimulated by \ncampaigners including Ralph Nader in the United \nStates ( 31), and given intellectual strength by scien -\ntists such as William Haddon Jr ( 32, 33 ).TABLE 1.3\nEstimated global research and development  \nfunding for selected topics \nDisease or injury US$ millions 1990 DALYs\nranking2020 DALYs\nranking\nHIV/AIDS 919–985 2 10\nMalaria           60 8 —\nDiarrhoeal diseases          32 4 9\nRoad trafﬁc crashes    24–33 9 3\nTuberculosis    19–33 — 7\nDALYs: disability-adjusted life years.\nSource: reference 24.\nROAD INJU RY PREVENTION AND CONTROL –\nTHE NEW UNDERST ANDING\n�Road crash injury is largely preventable and predictable;\nit is a human-made problem amenable to rational \nanalysis and countermeasure\n�Road safety is a multisectoral issue and a public health\nissue – all sectors, including health, need to be fully\nengaged in r esponsibilit y, activity and advocacy for r oad\ncrash injury pr evention\n�Common driving err ors and common pedestrian\nbehaviour should not lead to death and serious injury –\nthe traf fic system should help users to cope with\nincreasingly demanding conditions\n�The vulnerability of the human body should be a\nlimiting design parameter for the traffic system and speed\nmanagement is central\n�Road crash injury is a social equity issue – equal\nprotection to all r oad users should be aimed for since\nnon-motor vehicle users bear a dispr oportionate shar e\nof road injury and risk\n�Technology transfer fr om high-income to low-income\ncountries needs to fit local conditions and should address\nresear ch-based local needs\n�Local knowledge needs to inform the implementation\nof local solutionsFIGURE 1.1\nThe road safety paradigm shift')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 30})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '8 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n Experience shows that with political will and a \ncommitment to achieve effective safety manage -\nment, a rapid and signiﬁcant reduction in road \ninjuries can be achieved. The efforts required, as \nwill be outlined in this report, include ( 25, 34 ):\n— a scientiﬁc approach to the topic;\n— the provision, careful analysis and interpre -\ntation of good data;\n— the setting-up of targets and plans;\n— the creation of national and regional \nresearch capacity;\n— institutional cooperation across sectors.\nThe need for good data and a scientiﬁc \napproach\nRoad trafﬁc injury prevention is a highly politicized \nissue. Most people have their own opinions on \nwhat could make the roads safer. Anecdotal infor -\nmation and its reporting by the media all too often \nallow issues to be understood as major trafﬁc safety \nproblems requiring priority action, which in turn \nputs pressure on policy-makers to respond. Policy \ndecisions for effective road injury prevention need \nto be based on data and objective information, not \non anecdotal evidence.\n First, data on the incidence and types of crashes \nare needed. After that, a detailed understanding of \nthe circumstances that lead to crashes is required to \nguide safety policy. Furthermore, knowledge of how \ninjuries are caused and of what type they are is a \nvaluable instrument for identifying interventions and \nfor monitoring the effectiveness of interventions.\n In many low-income and middle-income \ncountries, systematic efforts to collect road trafﬁc \ndata are not well developed and underreporting of \ndeaths and serious injuries is common. The health \nsector has an important responsibility to ensure \nthat the necessary data systems are established and \nthat data on the main injury problems and on the \neffectiveness of interventions are communicated to \na wider audience.\n Only by systematic and data-led management of \nthe leading road injury problems will signiﬁcant \nreductions in exposure to crash risk and in the \nseverity of crashes be achieved.Road safety as a public health issue\nTraditionally, road trafﬁc safety has been assumed \nto be the responsibility of the transport sector, with \nthe main focus within this sector limited to build -\ning infrastructure and managing trafﬁc growth.\nRoad safety agencies and research institutes\nWith the sharp increases in motorization in the 1960s \nin many developed countries, trafﬁc safety agencies \nwere often set up, usually located within a govern -\nment’s transport department. Often, though, there \nwas little coordination between these bodies and \nother government departments with responsibilities \nrelating to road safety, either nationally or locally. In \nsome cases, for example, vehicle safety standards had \nbeen developed by departments dealing with trade \nand industry, while trafﬁc law enforcement was dealt \nwith at the local or regional level, controlled by the \njustice department. In general, the public health sec -\ntor was slow to become involved ( 34–38 ).\n A second development was the creation of national \ntechnical and scientiﬁc support bodies on road traf -\nﬁc, in which road safety decision-making formed \na part. Examples included the Swedish National \nRoad and Trafﬁc Research Institute created in 1971, \nthe United Kingdom Road Research Laboratory \n(now TRL Ltd), and the Accident Research Units in \nAdelaide and Sydney, Australia, as well as the Austral -\nian Road Research Board. In the United States, such \nresearch units were embedded within the national \ntrafﬁc safety agency so as to feed more directly into \npolicy-making. Formal advisory bodies, such as the \nNational Transportation Safety Board and the Trans -\nportation Research Board (part of the United States \nNational Academy of Sciences), were also set up to \nprovide independent advice and guidance.\n The combination of new, dedicated institutes \non road safety and greater scientiﬁc research has \nin many cases produced major changes in thinking \nabout trafﬁc safety and in interventions ( 34). How -\never, at the same time, there is often a real conﬂict \nbetween the aims of trafﬁc safety lobbies and those \nof campaigners for increased mobility or for envi -\nronmental concerns. In such cases, the lobby for \nmobility has frequently been the dominant one. In \nthe long term, increases in mobility, without the ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 31})","('type', 'Document')"

This \nhas placed a heavy burden on the health sector.\n Road crash injuries are indeed a major public \nhealth issue, and not just an offshoot of vehicular \nmobility. The health sector would greatly beneﬁt \nfrom better road injury prevention in terms of \nfewer hospital admissions and a reduced severity of \ninjuries. It would also be to the health sector’s gain \nif – with safer conditions on the roads guaranteed \nfor pedestrians and cyclists – more people were to \nadopt the healthier lifestyle of walking or cycling, \nwithout fearing for their safety.\nThe public health approach\nThe public health approach to road trafﬁc injury \nprevention is based on science. The approach \ndraws on knowledge from medicine, biomechan -\nics, epidemiology, sociology, behavioural science, \ncriminology, education, economics, engineering \nand other disciplines.\n While the health sector is only one of many \nbodies involved in road safety – and usually not \neven the leading one – it nonetheless has important \nroles to play (see Figure 1.2). These include:• discovering, through injury surveillance and \nsurveys, as much as possible about all aspects of \nroad crash injury – by systematically collecting \ndata on the magnitude, scope, characteristics \nand consequences of road trafﬁc crashes;\n• researching the causes of trafﬁc crashes and \ninjuries, and in doing so trying to determine:\n— causes and correlates of road crash injury,\n— factors that increase or decrease risk,\n— factors that might be modiﬁable through \ninterventions;\n• exploring ways to prevent and reduce the \nseverity of injuries in road crashes – by \ndesigning, implementing, monitoring and \nevaluating appropriate interventions;\n• helping to implement, across a range of set -\ntings, interventions that appear promising, \nespecially in the area of human behaviour, \ndisseminating information on the outcomes, \nand evaluating the cost-effectiveness of these \nprogrammes;\n• working to persuade policy-makers and \ndecision-makers of the necessity to address \ninjuries in general as a major issue, and of the \nimportance of adopting improved approaches \nto road trafﬁc safety;\n• translating effective science-based information \ninto policies and practices that protect pedestri -\nans, cyclists and the occupants of vehicles;\n• promoting capacity building in all these areas, \nparticularly in the gathering of information \nand in research.\nPREVENTION AND CONTRO L\nEVALUA TIONRESEARCHINJU RY SURV EILLANC E\nPOLICYSERVICE SADVOCACYPUBLIC\nHEAL THFIGURE 1.2\nRoad trafﬁc injury as a public health problem')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 32})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '10 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n Cross-sectoral collaboration is essential here, \nand this is something the public health sector is in \na good position to promote.\nRoad safety as a social equity issue\nStudies show that motor vehicle crashes have a dis -\nproportionate impact on the poor and vulnerable \nin society. These are also the people with usually \nlittle inﬂuence over policy decisions ( 40, 41 ). Even \nin high-income countries, poor children are at \ngreater risk than children from more prosperous \nfamilies ( 41–43 ).\n Poorer people comprise the majority of casualties \nand lack ongoing support in the event of long-term \ninjury. Lower socioeconomic groups have limited \naccess to post-crash emergency health care ( 44). In \naddition, in many developing countries, the costs of \nprolonged medical care, the loss of the family bread -\nwinner, the cost of a funeral, and the loss of income \ndue to disability can push families into poverty ( 45). \nIn Mexico, the second commonest cause of children \nbeing orphaned is trafﬁc crashes ( 45).\n In developing countries, the population groups \nexposed to the highest risks of injury and death \nfrom road crashes – for example, pedestrians and \nusers of motorized two-wheelers – are from lower \nsocioeconomic groups ( 40, 46 ). They face a greater \nlikelihood of injury, since affordable transport poses \nhigher risks in these places than private car use.\n A large proportion of the road crash victims \nin low-income and middle-income countries are \npedestrians and cyclists. They beneﬁt the least from \npolicies designed for motorized travel, but bear a \ndisproportionate share of the disadvantages of \nmotorization in terms of injury, pollution and the \nseparation of communities.\n In high-income countries, the risks associated \nwith walking, cycling and motorcycling remain \nvery high in relation to those of car travel – the \nprincipal focus of urban and rural highway provi -\nsion since motorization levels rose sharply in the \n1960s ( 47, 48 ).\n In many countries, the absence of a voice for the \nmost vulnerable groups has meant that the safety \nof pedestrians and cyclists is often disregarded in \nfavour of motorized travel. Equal protection for all road users should be a \nguiding rule, to avoid an unfair burden of injury \nand death for poorer people and vulnerable road \nusers ( 40, 49 ). This issue of equity is a central one \nfor reducing the global burden of road crash death \nand injury.\nSystems that accommodate human error\nThe traditional view in road safety has been that \nwhen crashes occur, they are usually the sole \nresponsibility of individual road users, despite the \nfact that other factors beyond their control may \nhave come into play, such as the poor design of \nroads or vehicles. It is still widely held today that \nsince human error is a factor in some 90% of road \ncrashes, the leading response should be to persuade \nroad users to adopt “error-free” behaviour. Accord -\ning to this policy, information and publicity should \nform the backbone of road trafﬁc injury preven -\ntion, rather than being one element of a much \nmore comprehensive programme ( 50, 51 ).\n Human error on the roads does not always lead \nto disastrous consequences. Error by a road user, \nthough, may indeed trigger a crash, but not neces -\nsarily be its underlying cause. In addition, human \nbehaviour is governed not only by individual \nknowledge and skills, but also by the environment \nin which the behaviour takes place ( 52). Indirect \ninﬂuences, such as the design and layout of the \nroad, the nature of the vehicle, and trafﬁc laws and \ntheir enforcement – or lack of enforcement – affect \nbehaviour in important ways. For this reason, the \nuse of information and publicity on their own is \ngenerally unsuccessful in reducing road trafﬁc col -\nlisions ( 26, 34, 35, 53 ).\n Error is part of the human condition. Aspects of \nhuman behaviour in the context of road trafﬁc safety \ncan certainly be altered. Nonetheless, errors can  \nalso be effectively reduced by changing the imme -\ndiate environment, rather than focusing solely on \nchanging the human condition ( 54).\n In the ﬁeld of road safety, it has proved difﬁcult \nto overcome the traditional overreliance on single \napproaches ( 26, 34, 39, 55, 56 ). Road safety policy-\nmakers in north-western Europe are increasingly \nacknowledging, though, that the road trafﬁc system ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 33})","('type', 'Document')"

However, as \nthe Swedish Committee of Inquiry into Road Traf -\nﬁc Responsibility concluded ( 59):\nIn order to achieve a safe transport system, there must \nbe a change in our views concerning responsibility, to \nthe extent that system designers are given clearly deﬁned \nresponsibility for designing the road system on the basis of \nactual human capabilities, thereby preventing the occur -\nrence of those cases of death and serious injury that are \npossible to predict and prevent.\nSystems that account for the vulnerability \nof the human body\nThe uncertainty of human behaviour in a complex \ntrafﬁc environment means that it is unrealistic to \nexpect that all crashes can be prevented. However, \nif greater attention in designing the transport sys -\ntem were given to the tolerance of the human body \nto injury, there could be substantial beneﬁts. It is \ncertainly within the bounds of possibility to try to \nensure that if crashes do occur, they do not, as a \nmatter of course, lead to serious public health loss.\n In the majority of serious and fatal crashes, \ninjuries are caused because loads and accelerations, \nexceeding those the body can tolerate, are applied by \nsome part of the car ( 60). Pedestrians, for example, \nincur a risk of about 80% of being killed at a collision \nspeed of 50 kilometres/hour (km/h), as opposed \nto a 10% risk at speeds of 30 km/h. At speeds of \nover 30 km/h, motorists, pedestrians and cyclists \nincreasingly make mistakes, the consequences of \nwhich are often fatal. The human tolerance to injury \nfor a pedestrian hit by a car will be exceeded if the \nvehicle is travelling at over 30 km/h ( 61).\n Most trafﬁc systems, however, whether in \ndeveloping or developed countries, go beyond \nthese limits on a regular basis. Separating cars and \npedestrians on the road by providing pavements \nis very often not done. Speed limits of 30 km/h \nin shared-space residential areas are commonly \nnot implemented. Car and bus fronts, as generally designed, do not provide protection for pedestrians \nagainst injury at collision speeds of 30 km/h or \ngreater.\n For car occupants, wearing seat-belts in well-\ndesigned cars can provide protection to a maximum \nof 70 km/h in frontal impacts and 50 km/h in side \nimpacts ( 61). Higher speeds could be tolerated if the \ninterface between the road infrastructure and vehi -\ncle were to be well-designed and crash-protective \n– for example, by the provision of crash cushions \non sharp ends of roadside barriers. However, most \ninfrastructure and speed limits in existence today \nallow much higher speeds without the presence \nof crash-protective interfaces between vehicle and \nroadside objects, and without signiﬁcant use of \nseat-belts. This is particularly the case in many low-\nincome and middle-income countries.\n In all regions of the world, to prevent road death \nand disabling injury, a trafﬁc system better adapted \nto the physical vulnerabilities of its users needs to \nbe created – with the use of more crash-protective \nvehicles and roadsides.\nTechnology transfer from high-income \ncountries\nTransport systems developed in high-income \ncountries may not ﬁt well with the safety needs \nof low-income and middle-income countries for \na variety of reasons, including the differences in \ntrafﬁc mix ( 50, 62, 63 ).\n In low-income countries, walking, cycling, \nmotorcycling and use of public transport are the \npredominant transport modes. In North America \nand Europe, there are between two and three peo -\nple per car. In China and India, on the other hand, \nthere are 280 and 220 people per car, respectively \n(64), and while it is predicted that car ownership \nwill increase in these countries, it will still remain \nlow in terms of cars per capita for another 20–30 \nyears ( 49).\n In developing countries, roads often carry a \nwide range of users – from heavy good vehicles \nto bicycles and pedestrians without any separation. \nAmong the pedestrians, the most vulnerable are \nchildren and older people.

Such a view may \nhave arisen through imported expertise from \ndeveloped countries as much as from domestic \nsources ( 66). This tends to lead to models of infra -\nstructure from developed countries being adopted \nto cater to the longer-term transport needs. How -\never, in most low-income countries, safety should \nbe promoted within existing conditions, and these \ninclude: low per capita incomes, the presence of \nmixed trafﬁc, a low capacity for capital intensive \ninfrastructure, and a different situation as regards \nlaw enforcement ( 50).\n In high-income settings, new strategies and \nprogrammes for trafﬁc injury prevention generally \nrequire considerable analysis and planning before \nimplementation. In developing countries, though, \nbecause of the scarcity of resources, the priority \nshould be the import and adaptation of proven and \npromising methods from developed nations, and \na pooling of information as to their effectiveness \nin the imported settings among other low-income \ncountries ( 67).\nThe new model\nIn all parts of the world, whatever the level of \nmotorization, there is a need to improve the safety \nof the trafﬁc system for all its users, and to reduce \ncurrent inequalities in the risk of incurring road \ncrash injuries.\n To achieve this, advances in road safety will \nrequire an approach that includes various key ele -\nments absent from previous efforts. This will entail \npolicy-makers, decision-makers, professionals and \npractitioners recognizing that the trafﬁc injury \nproblem is an urgent one, but one for which solu -\ntions are already largely known. It will require \nthat road safety strategies be integrated with other strategic, and sometimes competing goals, such as \nthose relating to the environment and to accessibil -\nity and mobility.\n A key factor in tackling the growing road trafﬁc \ninjury burden is the creation of institutional capac -\nity across a range of interlinking sectors, backed by \nboth strong political commitment and adequate \nand sustainable resources.\nA systems approach\nAn essential tool for effective road crash injury \nprevention is the adoption of a systems approach (68) \nto:\n— identify problems;\n— formulate strategy;\n— set targets;\n— monitor performance.\n Road safety efforts must be evidence-based, \nfully costed, properly resourced and sustainable.\n In the United States some 30 years ago, William \nHaddon Jr inspired safety professionals when he \ntalked about road transport as an ill-designed, \n“man-machine” system needing comprehensive \nsystemic treatment. He deﬁned three phases of the \ntime sequence of a crash event – pre-crash, crash \nand post-crash – as well as the epidemiological \ntriad of human, machine and environment that can \ninteract during each phase of a crash. The resulting \nnine-cell Haddon Matrix models a dynamic sys -\ntem, with each cell of the matrix allowing oppor -\ntunities for intervention to reduce road crash injury \n(32) (see Figure 1.3).\n This work led to substantial advances in the \nunderstanding of the behavioural, road-related and \nvehicle-related factors that affect the number and \nseverity of casualties in road trafﬁc. The “systems” \napproach seeks to identify and rectify the major \nsources of error or design weakness that contribute \nto fatal and severe injury crashes, as well as to miti -\ngate the severity and consequences of injury.\n Building on Haddon’s insights, a wide range of \nstrategies and techniques for casualty reduction \nhave since been tested internationally, through \nscientiﬁc research and empirical observation.

In low-income and middle-income \ncountries, systemic safety management is generally \nweaker, and needs to be strengthened.\n Evidence from North America, Australia and \nEurope shows that integrated strategic programmes \nproduce a marked decline in road deaths and seri -\nous injuries ( 34, 69, 70 ). A recent review of countries \nwith the lowest death rates – the Netherlands, Swe -\nden and the United Kingdom – concluded that while \nit was accepted that there was scope for improve -\nment, their progress had been due to continuing \nplanned systemic improvements over recent decades \naimed at vehicles, roads and users ( 25). Chapter 4 \ndiscusses the measures that have contributed to the \nrelative successes of these programmes.\n While progress has been made in many highly-\nmotorized countries, the practical realization of the \nsystems approach remains the most important chal -\nlenge for road safety policy-makers and professionals. At the same time, there are plenty of examples \nof the mistakes that highly-motorized nations have \nmade in attempts to improve safety. If newly-\nmotorizing nations could avoid such mistakes, a \nlarge proportion of road crash injuries could be \navoided ( 26, 56, 64 ). Such mistakes include:\n— the failure to adopt strategies or interven -\ntions based on evidence;\n— expenditure on ineffective but easy policy \noptions;\n— a focus on the mobility of vehicle users at the \nexpense of the safety of vulnerable road users;\n— insufﬁcient attention to the design of trafﬁc \nsystems and insufﬁcient professional scru -\ntiny of the detail of trafﬁc safety policy.\n The errors also included those of omission, as \nopportunities to prevent deaths and injuries by \nmeasures such as the design of better vehicles and \nless hazardous roadsides, and improving trauma \ncare systems, were in many cases missed ( 56).\nDeveloping institutional capacity\nThe development of trafﬁc safety policy involves a \nwide range of participants representing a diverse \ngroup of interests (see Figure 1.4). In many coun -\ntries, responsibilities for road safety are spread over \ndifferent levels of government with policy being \ndecided at local, national and international levels. \nIn the United States, for example, responsibilities \nare split between the federal government and the \nindividual states.

"('page_content', '14 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n The construction of multisectoral institutional \ncapacity, both in the governmental and non -\ngovernmental spheres, is a key to developing road \nsafety, and can only be delivered by a national, \npolitical commitment (see Box 1.2). As Wesemann \nobserves, there is sufﬁcient evidence to show that \nfree-market mechanisms are no substitute for gov -\nernment intervention when it comes to providing \ngreater safety ( 71).\nThe role of government\nHistorically, in most highly-motorized countries, \ngovernmental responsibilities for trafﬁc safety policy \nfall within the transport ministry or the police \ndepartment. Other government departments such \nas those of justice, health, planning and education \nmay also have responsibilities for key areas. In some \ninstances, vehicle safety standards are handled by the \ndepartment (or ministry) of industry.\n Trinca et al. – in their historical analysis of how \ngovernments have dealt with road safety – conclude \nthat in many cases the institutional arrangements \nfor trafﬁc safety have been fragmentary and lacking a strong lead, and that road safety \ninterests have been submerged by \nother competing interests ( 34).\n The experience of several coun -\ntries indicates that effective strat-\negies for reducing trafﬁc injury \nhave a greater chance of being \napplied if there is a separate govern -\nment agency with the power and \nthe budget to plan and implement \nits programme ( 34). Examples of \n“stand-alone” trafﬁc safety agencies \nare limited. However, in the 1960s, \nSweden and the United States cre -\nated trafﬁc safety bodies, separate \nfrom the main transport depart -\nments, that oversaw the implemen -\ntation, in a relatively short period of \ntime, of a range of new road safety \ninterventions.\n The Swedish Road Safety Ofﬁce \n(SRSO) was established in the \nlate 1960s, with responsibility for \nroad safety. Though it lacked signiﬁcant powers \nor resources, the number of road deaths between \n1970 and the mid-1980s was reduced each year. \nIn 1993, the SRSO merged with the more power -\nful and better-resourced Swedish National Road \nAdministration (SNRA), to which the ministry \nof transport and communications delegated full \nresponsibility for road safety policy.\n In the United States – against a background \nof sharply rising road casualties – the Highway \nSafety Act of 1970 created a trafﬁc safety agency, \nthe National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administra -\ntion (NHTSA). NHTSA delivered the ﬁrst set of \nvehicle safety standards and encouraged a new \nway of thinking about trafﬁc safety strategy. The \nagency is responsible for reducing deaths, injuries \nand economic losses resulting from motor vehicle \ncrashes. It aims to accomplish this by setting and \nenforcing safety performance standards for motor \nvehicles and motor vehicle equipment, and by \nproviding grants to state and local governments to \nenable them to conduct effective local road safety \nprogrammes.

THE FUNDAMENTALS  • 15\nBOX 1.2\nReducing trafﬁc fatalities in Bogotá, Colombia\nOver an eight-year period from 1995 to 2002, the Colombian capital, Bogotá, with a population of seven million, \nimplemented a range of policies to reduce fatal and non-fatal injuries from external causes. As a result, the number \nof trafﬁc-related deaths fell over the period by almost a half – from 1387 in 1995 to 697 in 2002.\n The ﬁrst measure was to set up a uniﬁed data system on violence and crime, designed by the Institute of Forensic \nMedicine and Science to gather data on deaths from violence, and in particular from trafﬁc crashes. Using the \nstatistics on road trafﬁc crashes in Bogotá, the interagency Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance of Injuries \nfrom External Causes then produced a set of public policies aimed at reducing the number of accidents, improving \nmobility around the city and increasing the safety of road users.\nImproving the performance and image of trafﬁc police\nThe following year, 2000 trafﬁc police who had failed to enforce trafﬁc regulations and, in many cases, were guilty of \ncorruption were replaced. Responsibility for regulating trafﬁc and enforcing rules was transferred to the Metropolitan \nPolice, which assigned more than 1000 ofﬁcers and 500 auxiliaries to trafﬁc duties. This police force now has a \npositive public image and concentrates exclusively on enforcing trafﬁc discipline. Ofﬁcers found acting corruptly are \ndismissed.\n Since 1996, spot checks have been carried out for drunken driving. Drivers failing the test have their vehicles \nimpounded and are ﬁned around US$ 150. The media are closely involved with these checks, conducted on weekends \nat crash black spots. Speed cameras have also been set up on the city’s main roads.\n In 1998, the Colombian National University was commissioned to carry out research into trafﬁc crashes. Based \non their ﬁndings, further decisions to increase road safety were taken, including the construction of highways, \npavements and pedestrian bridges. The study also identiﬁed individual behaviour that increased the risk of trafﬁc \ninjuries, and from this drew up civic education programmes on trafﬁc safety.\nAttempts to change behaviour\nOne of these programmes, launched by the city’s mayor, was aimed at changing people’s behaviour on the roads. \nMeasures promoted included the wearing of safety belts and observing pedestrian crossings. While the Highway \nCode already included these rules and people were generally aware of them, most people had failed to observe them \nand the authorities had generally failed to enforce them.\n In the programme, mime was used on numerous sites throughout Bogotá. The mime actors working for the \nprogramme used sign language to point out to drivers that they were not wearing seat-belts, or that they had failed \nto give way at pedestrian crossings. At ﬁrst, drivers were simply warned and told to change their behaviour. If this \nfailed, a trafﬁc policeman stepped in and handed out a ﬁne, to the applause of onlookers. Nowadays, over 95% of \ndrivers have been found to observe these rules.\nConverting space into pedestrian areas\nSince 1996, radical steps have been taken to win back areas from street traders and seasonal vendors. Large public \nspaces that had been taken over by vendors or vehicles have been converted into pedestrian areas, with new \npavements and pedestrian bridges constructed.\n In addition to the trafﬁc police, the administration employs some 500 guides in its Bogotá Mission programme \n– young people trained in trafﬁc regulations, ﬁrst aid, preventive safety measures and the detailed layout of the \ncity. Their task is to encourage safe behaviour on public roads.\nMass transport system\nA new mass transport system, known as the TransMilenio, has not only improved urban transport and mobility, but \nhas also reduced the number of trafﬁc injuries along its routes, with the construction of infrastructure to ensure the \nsafety of pedestrians and other road users. Surrounding areas have also been improved with better lighting and \nother equipment to make the system safer, more user-friendly and more efﬁcient.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 38})","('type', 'Document')"

NHTSA also conducts \nresearch on trafﬁc safety and driver behaviour.\n While giving responsibility for road safety to a \nstand-alone agency is likely to increase the priority \ngiven to road safety, strong political support and \nactions from other agencies are essential to bring \nabout major changes ( 72). If the establishment of \na stand-alone agency to coordinate activity is not \npossible, then an alternative is to strengthen the \nexisting road safety unit, giving it greater powers \nwithin the government transport ministry ( 34).\n The experience from a wide range of countries \nis that, whatever the organizational structure, it is \nimportant that the lead governmental organization \nfor road safety should be clearly deﬁned, with its \nspeciﬁc responsibilities and coordinating roles set \nout ( 66, 72 ).\nParliamentary committees\nExperience worldwide demonstrates that effec -\ntive road safety policies can also arise out of the \nefforts of informed and committed members of \nparliament.\n In the Australian state of New South Wales in the \nearly 1980s, the Parliamentary Standing Committee \non Road Safety was responsible for the introduction \nand full implementation of random breath test -\ning, which led to a 20% reduction in deaths and \n– according to surveys – was supported by over 90% \nof people. Earlier, in the neighbouring state of Victo -\nria, political action and a report by a parliamentary \ncommittee had led to the world’s ﬁrst legislation on \nthe compulsory use of front seat-belts. The law in \nVictoria came into effect at the beginning of 1971; \nby the end of that year car occupant deaths had \nfallen by 18%, and by 1975 by 26% ( 73).\n Joint groups comprising legislators and profession -\nals can also make a valuable contribution. In the United \nKingdom in the 1980s, for example, a cross-party \ncoalition of members of parliament came together \nwith concerned professionals and nongovernmental \norganizations to form the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS). The ﬁrst success \nof the Council – which campaigned strongly for road \nsafety policy to be based on evidence – was in having \nlegislation passed for front seat-belt use. PACTS went \non to argue for, and eventually see, the introduction of \nfurther measures, including speed humps and the use \nof rear seat-belts.\n A sympathetic institutional climate needs to be \nbuilt up where the mutual encouragement of road \ninjury prevention professionals and policy-makers \n– both in the executive and the legislature – can pro -\nvide a stimulus and effective response. It is important \nthat legislative bodies provide both authorization and \nfunding support to the relevant government agencies \nto carry out road safety initiatives.\nResearch\nRational decision-making in public policy is \ndependent on impartial research and information. \nDeveloping research capacity nationally is a central \nfeature of the new model of road safety ( 74, 75 ) (see \nBox 1.3). Without research capacity, there exist few \nmeans to overcome misconceptions and prejudices \nabout road crash injuries.\n National and community research – as opposed \nto relying solely on international research – is \nimportant for identifying local problems and local -\nized groups at increased risk of road injury. It also \nhelps to ensure a cadre of national and local pro -\nfessionals who can use research ﬁndings to calcu -\nlate the implications for policy and programmes. \nFurthermore, the national evaluation effort needs \nto be led by research professionals, since it is only \nthrough implementation and thorough evaluation \nthat effective programmes evolve.\n The independence of research and its separation \nfrom the executive function in developing public \npolicy is necessary for ensuring quality and to pro -\ntect the research body against short-term political \npressures, but at the same time interaction between \nthe two is essential ( 34).\n There are many examples of the role of inde -\npendent research effort carried out by universities \nand national research laboratories in developing \nnational and international policy.

Efforts at capacity development in the ﬁeld of health research have been \nconducted for several decades by international, bilateral and private organizations. Traditionally, such programmes \nprovided funds to train scientists from the developing world in centres of excellence in developed countries. In \nthe ﬁeld of road trafﬁc injury prevention, there are several types of initiative that can provide models for capacity \ndevelopment.\n■ Network development at the institutional level allows for exchange of information, the sharing of experiences, \nand the fostering of collaborative projects and research studies. The WHO Collaborating Centres for Violence \nand Injury Prevention are one global example of this model. Another, at regional level, is the Injury Prevention \nInitiative for Africa.\n■ Another model is to support schemes that allow scientists and professionals to exchange research ideas and \nﬁndings, develop proposals, mentor younger researchers and carry out research directed at policy-making. The \nglobal Road Trafﬁc Injury Research Network is an example of such a framework that focuses on researchers \nfrom low-income and middle-income countries.\n■ A third model for capacity development is to strengthen university departments and research institutes in the \ndeveloping world so as to generate a critical mass of appropriately trained professionals. The Indian Institute \nof Technology and Universiti Putra Malaysia are examples of centres with regular training programmes on \nroad safety.\n■ A fourth model is to strengthen career development pathways of trained professionals and to prevent \ntheir drain from low-income and middle-income countries. Both of these are important for attracting and \nretaining valuable human resources. Part of such a strategy includes establishing positions for road trafﬁc \ninjury prevention in appropriate ministries – such as those of health and transport – and ﬁnding incentives to \nencourage professionals in such posts to perform at a high level.\nIn recent years, there have been growing concerns about the impact of training programmes and attempts have \nbeen made to devise methods to evaluate them.

Its objectives include: \nestablishing and maintaining the highest pos -\nsible level of post-impact care for those injured \nin crashes; developing undergraduate and post -\ngraduate training programmes; gathering and dis -\nseminating hard clinical data that can be used to \nidentify trafﬁc injury problems; actively promoting \ninjury prevention measures; and supporting com -\nmunity awareness programmes ( 34).\n In the 20 years since its inception, the advocacy \nefforts of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) \nhave had remarkable success.

It recognizes \nthat road deaths and serious injuries can be avoided \nby adopting a culture of safety involving all the key \nparticipants and by implementing important safety \nmeasures more widely and systematically ( 55, 70 ).\n In the new paradigm, the principle of social \nresponsibility involves the vehicle manufacturer \nproviding crash protection inside and outside the \nvehicle. The vehicle uses a road system where con -\nﬂict is minimized by design and energy transfer \nis controlled as far as possible. That system is then \nused by a community that complies with risk-\navoiding behavioural norms created by education, \nlegislation and enforcement ( 55).\n In this model, designers and builders are an \nintegral part of the systems approach to road safety \n(55). For the model to be effective, though, there \nmust also be accountability and a means to meas -\nure performance objectively. Two countries in particular have formally \nadopted the systems approach to road safety. \nBoth Sweden and the Netherlands, as described \nin the following sections, have put into legislation \nmodels in which effective partnerships are the key \nmethod of delivering road safety plans, setting \ntargets and introducing other safety performance \nindicators.\n Safety performance indicators, related to crashes \nor injuries, provide a test for ensuring that actions \nare as effective as possible and represent the best \nuse of public resources ( 78).\nSweden’s “Vision Zero”\nVision Zero – so called because its ultimate goal is \nno fatalities or severe injuries through road traf -\nﬁc crashes – has public health as its underlying \npremise ( 61) (see Box 1.4). It is a road safety policy \nthat puts the protection of the most vulnerable road \nusers at its centre.\nBOX 1.4\nVision Zero\nVision Zero is a trafﬁc safety policy, developed in Sweden in the late 1990s and based on four elements: ethics, \nresponsibility, a philosophy of safety, and creating mechanisms for change. The Swedish parliament voted in October \n1997 to adopt this policy and since then several other countries have followed suit.\nEthics\nHuman life and health are paramount. According to Vision Zero, life and health should not be allowed in the long \nrun to be traded off against the beneﬁts of the road transport system, such as mobility. Mobility and accessibility are \ntherefore functions of the inherent safety of the system, not vice versa as it is generally today.\nResponsibility\nUntil recently, responsibility for crashes and injuries was placed principally on the individual road user. In Vision Zero, \nresponsibility is shared between the providers of the system and the road users. The system designers and enforcers \n– such as those providing the road infrastructure, the car-making industry and the police – are responsible for the \nfunctioning of the system. At the same time, the road user is responsible for following basic rules, such as obeying \nspeed limits and not driving while under the inﬂuence of alcohol. If the road users fail to follow such rules, the \nresponsibility falls on the system designers to redesign the system, including rules and regulations.\nSafety philosophy\nIn the past, the approach to road safety was generally to put the onus on the road user. In Vision Zero, this is replaced \nby an outlook that has been used with success in other ﬁelds. Its two premises are that:\n■ human beings make errors;\n■ there is a critical limit beyond which survival and recovery from an injury are not possible.\n It is clear that a system that combines human beings with fast-moving, heavy machines will be very unstable.

"('page_content', '20 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n Vision Zero is a long-term strategy in which \nimprovements are delivered in gradual incre -\nments, and where, over time, the responsibility \nfor safety becomes shared by the designers and \nusers of the road trafﬁc system. The idea is that \na system more tolerant of human limitations will \nlead eventually to a changed division of responsi -\nbility between the car industry, the health sector, road safety engineering and trafﬁc planning ( 61).\n According to the policy, if the inherent safety of \nthe system cannot be changed, then the only radical \nway to reduce the road toll is to lower travel speeds. \nOn the other hand, if a substantial reduction in \nvehicle speed is unacceptable, the alternative has to \nbe investment to improve the inherent safety of the \nsystem, at a given level of desired mobility ( 61).BOX 1.4 (continued)\nIt is sufﬁcient for a driver of a vehicle to lose control for just a fraction of a second for a human tragedy to occur. The \nroad transport system should therefore be able to take account of human failings and absorb errors in such a way as \nto avoid deaths and serious injuries. Crashes and even minor injuries, on the other hand, need to be accepted. The \nimportant point is that the chain of events that leads to a death or disability must be broken, and in a way that is \nsustainable, so that over the longer time period loss of health is eliminated.\n The limiting factor of this system is the human tolerance to mechanical force. The chain of events leading to a \ndeath or serious injury can be broken at any point. However, the inherent safety of the system – and that of the road \nuser – is determined by people not being exposed to forces that go beyond human tolerance. The components of the \nroad transport system – including road infrastructure, vehicles and systems of restraint – must therefore be designed \nin such a way that they are linked to each other. The amount of energy in the system must be kept below critical limits \nby ensuring that speed is restricted.\nDriving mechanisms for change\nTo change the system involves following the ﬁrst three elements of the policy. While society as a whole beneﬁts \nfrom a safe road transport system in economic terms, Vision Zero relates to the citizen as an individual and his or \nher right to survive in a complex system. It is therefore the demand from the citizen for survival and health that is \nthe main driving force. In Vision Zero, the providers and enforcers of the road transport system are responsible to \ncitizens and must guarantee their safety in the long term. In so doing, they are necessarily required to cooperate \nwith each other, for simply looking after their own individual components will not produce a safe system. At the \nsame time, the road user has an obligation to comply with the basic rules of road safety .\n In Sweden, the main measures undertaken to date include:\n— setting safety performance goals for various parts of the road trafﬁc system;\n— a focus on vehicle crash protection, and support for the consumer information programme of the European \nNew Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP);\n— securing higher levels of seat-belt use and ﬁtting smart, audible seat-belt reminders in new cars;\n— installing crash-protective central barriers on single-carriageway rural roads;\n— encouraging local authorities to implement 30 km/h zones;\n— wider use of speed camera technology;\n— an increase in the number of random breath tests;\n— the promotion of safety as a competitive variable in road transport contracts.\n While the Vision Zero does not say that the ambitions on road safety historically have been wrong, the actions \nthat would have to be taken are partly different. The main differences probably can be found within how safety \nis being promoted; there are also some innovations that will come out as a result of the vision, especially in \ninfrastructure and speed management.\nA tool for all\nVision Zero is relevant to any country that aims to create a sustainable road transport system, and not just for the \nexcessively ambitious or wealthy ones. Its basic principles can be applied to any type of road transport system, at any \nstage of development. Adopting Vision Zero means avoiding the usual costly process of trial and error, and using from \nthe start a proven and effective method.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 43})","('type', 'Document')"

The three types of road function are:\no the ﬂow function – enabling high speeds for long-distance trafﬁc, frequently also involving large volumes \nof trafﬁc;\no the distributor function – helping to distribute trafﬁc to scattered destinations and serving regions and districts;\no the access function – enabling direct access to properties alongside a road.\n■ Speed limits should be set according to road function.\n■ Using appropriate design, the function of roads, their layout and their use should be made compatible, by:\no preventing the unintended use of roads;\no preventing large discrepancies in speed, direction and volume at moderate and high speeds;\no preventing confusion among road users by making the nature of roads more predictable.\nNecessary actions\nThe actions needed to achieve the safe and sustainable road systems include:\n■ the creation of partnerships at national, regional and local levels to re-engineer the road network, with a \ngreater emphasis on safety;\n■ a programme to be implemented in two phases, with a start-up period of two years, to reclassify the road network;\n■ a 30 km/h speed limit introduced as a general rule for all built-up areas, with powers given to local authorities \nto make exceptions.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 44})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '22 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n As with the Swedish pro -\ngramme, the sustainable safety \nprogramme in the Netherlands \ntakes, as its underlying premise, \nthat “man is the measure of all \nthings”. Its key aim is to re-\nengineer and manage the road \nnetwork so as to provide a safer \nsystem ( 58).\n Speed management is a central \ntheme. One of the goals is to con -\nvert as many urban roads as pos -\nsible to a “residential” function, \nwith a maximum speed limit of \n30 km/h. Previous experience in \nthe Netherlands with 30 km/h \nzones had shown that a casu -\nalty reduction of 22% could be \nachieved ( 58). Once it had been \nestablished that two thirds of \nthe Dutch urban road network \ncould be converted to 30 km/h \nzones, the programme – a joint \noperation between central and \nlocal government – reclassiﬁed \nthe road network and by 2001 \nhad converted as much as 50% \nof it into 30 km/h zones. A second phase of the \nprogramme will extend to 2010.\n The Institute for Road Safety Research has esti -\nmated that an annual return on investment for the \nscheme of 9% will be forthcoming, which repre -\nsents around twice the usual return of 4% from \nother large infrastructure projects.\nSetting targets\nSince the late 1980s, several countries have recog -\nnized that targets in road safety plans can be a use -\nful tool for promoting proven casualty reduction \nmeasures higher up the list of political priorities, \nand for helping to attract appropriate resources for \nthem. Many countries have set targets to reduce \nroad casualties, and some of these are shown in \nTable 1.4.\n International experience with numerical tar -\ngets in road safety programmes, documented by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) ( 80) and more recently by \nElvik ( 81) and ETSC ( 48), indicates that setting \nquantitative targets can lead to better programmes, \nmore effective use of resources and an improve -\nment in road safety performance. A prerequisite for \ntarget setting is the availability of data on deaths \nand injuries, as well as information on trafﬁc \ntrends.\n Elvik concluded that ambitious, long-term tar -\ngets set by national governments appear to be the \nmost effective in improving road safety perform -\nance ( 81).\n Targets must be quantitative, time-dependent, \neasily intelligible and possible to evaluate. Among \ntheir main purposes are:\n— to provide a rational means for identifying \nand carrying out interventions;\n— to motivate those working in road safety;TABLE 1.4\nExamples of current fatality reduction targets in usea \nCountry or area Base year  \nfor targetYear in which  \ntarget is to  \nbe realizedTarget reduction  \nin the number  \nof road trafﬁc fatalities\nAustralia 1997 2005 –10%\nAustria 1998–2000 2010 –50%\nCanada 1991–1996 2008–2010 –30%\nDenmark 1998 2012 –40%\nEuropean Union 2000 2010 –50%\nFinland 2000 2010 –37%\n2025 –75%\nFrance 1997 2002 –50%\nGreece 2000 2005 –20%\n2015 –40%\nIreland 1997 2002 –20%\nItaly 1998–2000 2010 –40%\nMalaysia 2001 2010 < 3 deaths/10 000 vehicles\nNetherlands 1998 2010 –30%\nNew Zealand 1999 2010 –42%\nPoland 1997–1999 2010 –43%\nSaudi Arabia 2000 2015 –30%\nSweden 1996 2007 –50%\nUnited Kingdom 1994–1998 2010 –40%\nUnited States 1996 2008 –20%\na It should be noted that some of these targets also include reductions in serious injury \nand are supplemented by other targets, e.g. to reduce the numbers of casualties among \nchildren.\nSources: references 48, 79 .')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 45})","('type', 'Document')"

All the same, there is no guarantee that \nsimply by setting targets, road safety performance \nwill improve ( 81). In addition to a target, realistic \nsafety programmes must be developed, properly \nimplemented and well monitored. A survey under -\ntaken of national road safety plans showed that plan -\nners need to consider ( 82):\n— how to balance the objectives of safety, \nmobility and environmental concern;\n— what barriers exist to implementing inter -\nventions, and how these could be overcome;\n— how meaningful accountability for the \nachievement of goals could be obtained.\n Policy-makers setting targets for higher safety \nlevels need to concern themselves with a wide \nrange of factors that inﬂuence safety ( 78, 83 ).\n In New Zealand, the road trafﬁc strategy sets \nfour levels of target.\n• The overall target is to reduce the socioeco -\nnomic costs of road crashes (including direct \nand indirect costs).\n• This should be achieved by meeting the sec -\nond level of targets, requiring speciﬁc reduc -\ntions in the numbers of fatalities and serious \ninjuries.\n• A third level of targets consists of perform -\nance indicators (including those related to \nspeed, drink driving and rates of seat-belt \nwearing) that are consistent with the targeted \nreductions in ﬁnal outcomes.\n• A fourth level of targets is concerned with insti -\ntutional delivery outputs (such as the number \nof police patrol hours and the kilometres of high-risk crash sites treated) that are required \nto achieve the third-level targets ( 25, 83, 84 ).\nPartnerships in the public and private  \nsectors\nSigniﬁcant progress has been made in establish -\ning different types of partnerships within tiers of \ngovernment and between the private and public \nsector. Some examples of effective partnerships are \nset out below.\nThe model of Victoria, Australia\nThe Australian state of Victoria has developed a \nstrong partnership between trafﬁc law enforce -\nment and trafﬁc injury compensation schemes, \nunderpinned by the use of research to provide \nevidence for new policies and practices. In this \nscheme, the Transport Accidents Commission \n(TAC), set up in 1986, compensates victims of road \ncrashes through a no-fault system (in which the \ninsurer pays for any damages incurred in a crash, \nregardless of which party was considered at fault), \nfunded by premiums that are levied as part of the \nannual vehicle registration charge.\n The TAC determined that a substantial invest -\nment in road injury prevention would be more \nthan offset by reduced payments in compensation. \nIt invested heavily in the road agency’s remedial \nprogramme for high-risk crash sites. It also helped \nthe police purchase enforcement technology so as \nto raise levels of enforcement, and it embarked on \nan intense series of public education campaigns. \nThe three separate ministries of the state govern -\nment – those of  transport, insurance and justice – \njointly set policy and coordinated the programme.\n A series of controlled enforcement and educa -\ntion programmes was undertaken, each subject to \nscientiﬁc evaluation. Victoria has a tradition of sci -\nentiﬁc evaluation of road safety interventions and \nenforcement practice, in particular, has in the past \nbeen shaped by research ﬁndings ( 85). An example \nis Victoria’s approach to the enforcement of speed \nlimits using speed cameras. In most other places, \nspeed cameras are generally sited at crash “black \nspots”, with signs and other overt signals maxi -\nmizing the focus on the speciﬁc site.

"('page_content', '24 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nthe objective, at least in urban areas, is to cover \nthe whole road network. The strategy is thus covert \nand random – and, to the motorist, unpredictable. \nThe link here between research and road safety \npolicy-making is strong – making the intervention \nmore effective. Since the potential beneﬁts of the \nprogramme are scientiﬁcally researched and pub -\nlicized, there is public support for the programme. \nThis support may not otherwise have been forth -\ncoming, as the seemingly draconian levels of \nenforcement might have led to public opposition.\n The Victorian model has been adapted and \nimplemented in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal \nprovince – an example of a successful transfer of \ntechnology from a high-income country ( 86).\nSafety partnerships in the United Kingdom\nIn 1998, the United Kingdom’s Department for \nTransport, together with other government depart -\nments, created a policy of allowing local multisecto -\nral partnerships, subject to strict ﬁnancial criteria, to \nrecover the costs of speed enforcement. The national \nproject brought in representatives from a wide range \nof government and professional sectors.\n In April 2000, pilot studies were launched in \neight areas. The core membership of the part -\nnerships included local authorities, the local law \ncourts, the Highways Agency and the police. Some \npilot areas also actively involved their local health \nsector organizations.\n In those pilot studies where comparisons could \nbe made, there was a 35% reduction in road crashes \ncompared with the long-term trend during the ﬁrst \ntwo years of the schemes, and a 56% reduction in \nfatal and serious pedestrian casualties ( 87).\n The introduction of the cost recovery system has \nbeen a good example of “joined-up” government \n– seamless partnerships across a range of sectors \n– at both a national and local level. The process has \nenabled a more consistent and rigorous approach to \nenforcement, and it has freed up resources to focus \non locally-targeted routes. In total, the system has \nreleased around £20 million of additional funds for \nlocal partnerships to spend on speed and trafﬁc sig -\nnal enforcement and on raising public awareness \nof the dangers of speeding. The beneﬁts to society, in terms of casualties saved, have been estimated at \naround £112 million in the ﬁrst two years of opera -\ntion ( 87).\nNew car assessment programmes\nPeople buying cars are becoming increasingly \naware of the importance of safe car design and \nthey frequently seek reliable information about \nthe safety performance of individual car models. \nNew Car Assessment Programmes (NCAPs) in \nwhich new car models are subjected to a range \nof crash tests and their performance rated with \na “star” system have been developed around the \nworld. Such programmes provide a resource for \nconsumers, promote safety and also give credit \nto the efforts of car manufacturers that focus on \nsafety. The ﬁrst NCAP was set up in 1978 in the \nUnited States, followed by the Australian NCAP \nin 1992 and the European version (EuroNCAP) \nin 1996.\n The EuroNCAP illustrates how a partner -\nship between government, and motoring and \nconsumer organizations can deliver an impor -\ntant source of impartial information about the \nperformance of new cars in realistic crash tests. \nEuroNCAP’s contributing organizations include \nthe departments of transport of France, Germany, \nthe Netherlands, Spain (Catalonia), Sweden and \nthe United Kingdom. Also participating are the \nAllgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club (ADAC), \nthe European Commission, the FIA Foundation, \nand – on behalf of European consumer organiza -\ntions – the International Consumer Research and \nTesting (ICRT).\n Types of whole vehicle tests (such as frontal \nimpact, side impact and pedestrian-friendliness) \nand test procedures (including velocity, ground \nclearance height and percentage overlap tests) vary \nacross the various NCAPs, making the comparison \nof systems based on crash tests more difﬁcult.\n Such information on the crash-worthiness of \nvehicles has helped consumers realize the value of \nsafety and take the information into account when \nthey purchase new vehicles. The car industry  \nhas consequently responded by making substan -\ntial improvements in car design over and above ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 47})","('type', 'Document')"

However, there has been \nlittle response to date to the pedestrian protection \ntests undertaken in the Australian and European \nprogrammes. Research has shown that cars with \nthree or four stars are approximately 30% safer, \ncompared with two-star cars or cars without a \nEuro-NCAP score, in car-to-car collisions ( 88).\n A promising similar development, led by the \nautomobile clubs in Europe, is seeking to devise a \nstar rating system for speciﬁc types of roads, so that \nroad builders are also encouraged to improve the \nsafety of their roads beyond the basic standards.\nConclusion\nRoad trafﬁc injuries and deaths are a major public \nhealth issue worldwide. Unless appropriate action \nis taken urgently, the problem will worsen globally. \nThis will particularly be the case in those develop -\ning countries where rapid motorization is likely to \noccur over the next two decades. A sizeable portion \nof the burden of injury will continue to be borne \nby vulnerable road users – pedestrians, cyclists and \nmotorcyclists.\n There is hope, though, that the devastating loss \nof life and health entailed in such a worsening sce -\nnario can be avoided. Over the last forty years the \nscience of trafﬁc safety has developed to a point \nwhere the effective strategies for preventing or \nreducing crashes and injuries are well known.\n A scientiﬁc, systems approach to the problem \nof road safety is essential, though it is not yet fully \naccepted in many places. The new model of under -\nstanding road safety can be summarized as follows:\n• Crash injury is largely predictable and largely \npreventable. It is a problem amenable to \nrational analysis and remedy.\n• Road safety policy must be based on a sound \nanalysis and interpretation of data, rather than \non anecdote.\n• Road safety is a public health issue that inti -\nmately involves a range of sectors, including that \nof health. All have their responsibilities and all \nneed to be fully engaged in injury prevention.\n• Since human error in complex trafﬁc systems \ncannot be eliminated entirely, environmental \nsolutions (including the design of roads and of vehicles) must help in making road trafﬁc \nsystems safer.\n• The vulnerability of the human body should \nbe a limiting design factor for trafﬁc systems, \ni.e. for vehicle and road design, and for set -\nting speed limits.\n• Road crash injury is a social equity issue, \nwith vulnerable road users bearing a dispro -\nportionate share of road injury and risk. The \nobjective must be equal protection.\n• Technology transfer from high-income to \nlow-income countries must be appropriate \nand should address local needs, as deter -\nmined by research.\n• Local knowledge needs to feed in to the \nimplementation of local solutions.\n In addition, the formidable challenge of reduc -\ning the level of human loss on the roads requires \nthe following to be developed:\n— increased capacity for policy-making, \nresearch and interventions, in both the pub -\nlic and private sectors;\n— national strategic plans, incorporating tar -\ngets where data allow;\n— good data systems for identifying problems \nand evaluating responses;\n— collaboration across a range of sectors, \nincluding the health sector;\n— partnerships between public and private sec -\ntors;\n— accountability, adequate resources and a \nstrong political will.\nReferences\n1.

"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 2.  THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 33\nIntroduction\nThe previous chapter showed that road trafﬁc inju -\nries are a major global public health and develop -\nment problem that will worsen in the years ahead \nif no signiﬁcant steps are taken to alleviate it. This \nchapter examines in greater depth the extent of the \nproblem of road trafﬁc injuries. The current global \nestimates and trends over time are ﬁrst discussed, \nwith projections and predictions. The sections that \nfollow examine the effects of motorization, the \nproﬁles of those affected by road trafﬁc injuries, \nand the socioeconomic and health impacts of road \ntrafﬁc collisions. Finally, there is a discussion of \nimportant issues related to data and the evidence \nfor road trafﬁc injury prevention.\nSources of data\nThe analysis in this chapter is based on evidence \non road trafﬁc injuries derived from four main \nsources:\n• The WHO mortality database and the WHO \nGlobal Burden of Disease (GBD), 2002, Version \n1 database (see Statistical Annex).\n• Recent studies by the World Bank ( 1) and the \nUnited Kingdom’s Transport Research Labora -\ntory (now TRL Ltd) ( 2). \n• Databases and web sites of various international \nand national organizations that compile road \ntransport statistics, including:\n— International Road Trafﬁc and Accident \nDatabase (IRTAD);\n— United Nations Economic Commission for \nEurope (UNECE);\n— Transport Safety Bureau, Australia.\n— Department of Transport, South Africa;\n— Department for Transport, United Kingdom;\n— Fatal Analysis Reporting System, United \nStates;\n— National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Adminis -\ntration (NHTSA), United States;\n• A review of available studies on various topics \nrelated to road trafﬁc injuries, including road \nsafety issues, in order to secure country and \nregional level data and evidence. The literature \nwas obtained from libraries, online journals \nand individuals.Magnitude of the problem\nMortality is an essential indicator of the scale of any \nhealth problem, including injury. It is important, \nthough, that non-fatal outcomes – or injury mor -\nbidity – should be measured and included, so as to \nreﬂect fully the burden of disease due to road trafﬁc \ncollisions. For each road trafﬁc injury death, there \nare dozens of survivors who are left with short-term \nor permanent disabilities that may result in continu -\ning restrictions on their physical functioning, psy -\nchosocial consequences or a reduced quality of life. \nThe assessment in this chapter of the magnitude of \nroad trafﬁc injuries, therefore, considers not only on \nmortality but also injuries and disability.\nGlobal estimates\nThe road trafﬁc injury problem began before the intro -\nduction of the car. However, it was with the car – and \nsubsequently buses, trucks and other vehicles – that \nthe problem escalated rapidly. By various accounts, \nthe ﬁrst injury crash was supposedly suffered by a \ncyclist in New York City on 30 May 1896, followed a \nfew months later by the ﬁrst fatality, a pedestrian in \nLondon ( 3). Despite the early concerns expressed over \nserious injury and loss of life, road trafﬁc crashes have \ncontinued to this day to exact their toll. Though the \nexact number will never be known, the number of \nfatalities was conservatively estimated to have reached \na cumulative total of 25 million by 1997 ( 4).\n WHO data show that in 2002 nearly 1.2 million \npeople worldwide died as a result of road trafﬁc inju -\nries (see Statistical Annex, Table A.2). This represents \nan average of 3242 persons dying each day around \nthe world from road trafﬁc injuries. In addition to \nthese deaths, between 20 million and 50 million \npeople globally are estimated to be injured or disa -\nbled each year ( 2, 5, 6 ).\n In the same year, the overall global road trafﬁc \ninjury mortality rate was 19.0 per 100 000 popula -\ntion (see Table 2.1). Low-income and middle-income \ncountries had a rate slightly greater than the global \naverage, while that for high-income countries was \nconsiderably lower. The vast majority – 90% – of \nroad trafﬁc deaths were in low-income and middle-\nincome countries. Only 10% of road trafﬁc deaths \noccurred in high-income countries.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 56})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '34 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n According to WHO data for 2002, road trafﬁc \ninjuries accounted for 2.1% of all global deaths \n(see Statistical Annex, Table A.2) and ranked as the \n11th leading cause of death (see Statistical Annex, \nTable A.3). Furthermore, these road trafﬁc deaths \naccounted for 23% of all injury deaths worldwide \n(see Figure 2.1).\n In 2002, road trafﬁc injuries were the ninth \nleading cause of disability-adjusted life years lost \n(see Statistical Annex, Table A.3), accounting \nfor over 38 million disability-adjusted life years \n(DALYs) lost, or 2.6% of the global burden of dis -\nease. Low-income and middle-income countries \naccount for 91.8% of the DALYs lost to road trafﬁc \ninjuries worldwide. These observations illustrate the fact that low-\nincome and middle-income countries carry most of \nthe burden of the world’s road trafﬁc injuries. \nRegional distribution\nThere is considerable regional variation, both in \nthe absolute number of road trafﬁc injury deaths \nand mortality rates (see Statistical Annex, Table \nA.2). The WHO Western Paciﬁc Region recorded \nthe highest absolute number of deaths in 2002, \nwith just over 300 000, followed by the WHO \nSouth-East Asia Region with just under 300 000. \nThese two regions together account for more than \nhalf of all road trafﬁc deaths in the world.\n As regards death rates, the WHO African Region \nhad the highest mortality rate in 2002, at 28.3 per \n100 000 population, followed closely by the low-\nincome and middle-income countries of the WHO \nEastern Mediterranean Region, at 26.4 per 100 000 \npopulation (see Figure 2.2 and Table 2.2).\n The high-income countries in Europe have the \nlowest road trafﬁc fatality rate (11.0 per 100 000 \npopulation) followed by those of the WHO West -\nern Paciﬁc Region (12.0 per 100 000 population). \nIn general, the regional averages for low-income \nand middle-income are much higher than corre -\nsponding rates for high-income countries.\n Signiﬁcant variations also arise between coun -\ntries; some features speciﬁc to individual countries \nare discussed below.Source: WHO Global Burden of Disease project, 2002, Version 1  \n(see Statistical Annex).Suicide\n16.9%\nViolence\n10.8%\nWar\n3.4%\nRoad traf fic injuries\n22.8%Other\nintentional injuries\n0.2%\nPoisoning\n6.7%Falls\n7.5%Fires\n6.2%Drowning\n7.3%Other\nunintentional injuries\n18.1%FIGURE 2.1\nDistribution of global injury mortality by causeTABLE 2.1\nEstimated global road trafﬁc injury-related deaths\nNumber Rate per \n100 000 \npopulationProportion  \nof total (%)\nLow-income and  \nmiddle-income countries1 065 988 20.2  90\nHigh-income countries 117 504 12.6  10\nTotal 1 183 492 19.0 100\nSource: WHO Global Burden of Disease project, 2002, Version 1 \n(see Statistical Annex).\nTABLE 2.2\nRoad trafﬁc injury mortality rates (per 100 000  \npopulation) in WHO regions, 2002\nWHO region Low-income and  \nmiddle-income \ncountriesHigh-income \ncountries\nAfrican Region 28.3 —\nRegion of the Americas 16.2 14.8\nSouth-East Asia Region 18.6 —\nEuropean Region 17.4 11.0\nEastern Mediterranean Region 26.4 19.0\nWestern Paciﬁc Region 18.5 12.0\nSource: WHO Global Burden of Disease project, 2002, Version 1 \n(see Statistical Annex).')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 57})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 2.  THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 35\nCountry estimates\nOnly 75 countries report vital registration data, \nincluding road trafﬁc injury data, to WHO that are \nsufﬁcient for analysis here (see Statistical Annex, \nTable A.4). The regional estimates, presented in the  \nsection above, are based on these data, as well as on  \nincomplete data from a further 35 countries and var i-\nous epidemiological sources.  These estimates indi -\ncate that African countries have some of the highest \nroad trafﬁc injury mortality rates. However, when \nexamining data from the individual 75 countries that  \nreport sufﬁcient data to WHO, a different picture \nemerges.

"('page_content', '36 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nTrends in road trafﬁc injuries\nGlobal and regional trends\nAccording to WHO data, road trafﬁc deaths have \nrisen from approximately 999 000 in 1990 ( 8) to \njust over 1.1 million in 2002 (see Statistical Annex, \nTable A.2) – an increase of around 10%. Low-\nincome and middle-income countries account for \nthe majority of this increase.\n Although the number of road trafﬁc injuries \nhas continued to rise in the world as a whole, \ntime series analysis reveals that road trafﬁc fatali -\nties and mortality rates show clear differences \nin the pattern of growth between high-income \ncountries, on the one hand, and low-income and \nmiddle-income countries on the other ( 2, 9–11 ). In \ngeneral, since the 1960s and 1970s, there has been \na decrease in the numbers and rates of fatalities in \nhigh-income countries such as Australia, Canada, \nGermany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United \nKingdom and the United States of America. At the \nsame time, there has been a pronounced rise in \nnumbers and rates in many low-income and mid -\ndle-income countries.\n The percentage change in road trafﬁc fatalities \nin different regions of the world for the period \n1987–1995 is shown in Figure 2.3. The trends are \nbased on a limited number of countries for which \ndata were available throughout the period and they \nare therefore inﬂuenced by the largest countries in \nthe regional samples. Such regional trends could \nmask national trends and the data should not be \nextrapolated to the national level. The regional clas -\nsiﬁcations employed are similar to, but not exactly \nthe same as those deﬁned by WHO. It is clear from \nthe ﬁgure that there has been an overall downward \ntrend in road trafﬁc deaths in high-income coun -\ntries, whereas many of the low-income and mid -\ndle-income countries have shown an increase since \nthe late 1980s. There are, however, some marked \nregional differences; Central and Eastern Europe \nwitnessed a rapid increase in road trafﬁc deaths \nduring the late 1980s, the rate of increase of which \nhas since declined. The onset of rapid increases in \nroad trafﬁc fatalities occurred later in Latin America \nand the Caribbean, from 1992 onwards. In contrast, \nnumbers of road trafﬁc deaths have risen steadily since the late 1980s in the Middle East and North \nAfrica and in Asia, particularly in the former. \n The reductions in road trafﬁc fatalities in high-\nincome countries are attributed largely to the \nimplementation of a wide range of road safety \nmeasures, including seat-belt use, vehicle crash \nprotection, trafﬁc-calming interventions and traf -\nﬁc law enforcement ( 2, 12). However, the reduction \nin the reported statistics for road trafﬁc injury does \nnot necessarily mean an improvement in road safety \nfor everyone. According to the International Road \nTrafﬁc and Accident Database (IRTAD), pedestrian \nand bicyclist fatalities have decreased more rapidly \nthan have fatalities among vehicle occupants. In \nfact, between 1970 and 1999, the proportion of \npedestrian and bicyclist fatalities fell from 37% to \n25% of all trafﬁc fatalities, when averaged across 28 \ncountries that report their data to IRTAD ( 13). These \nreductions could, however, be due, at least in part, \nto a decrease in exposure rather than an improve -\nment in safety ( 14).\nTrends in selected countries\nAs already mentioned, the regional trends do not \nnecessarily reﬂect those of individual countries.

"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 2.  THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 37\nTable 2.4 and Figures 2.4 and 2.5 \nshow how road trafﬁc mortal -\nity rates have changed with time \nin some countries. It can be seen \nfrom Figures 2.4 and 2.5 that some \nindividual countries’ trends in \nmortality rates do indeed reﬂect \nthe general trend in the number \nof road trafﬁc deaths. Thus in Aus -\ntralia, the mortality rate increased \n– with some annual ﬂuctuations \n– to peak at about 30 deaths per \n100 000 population in 1970, after \nwhich there was a steady decline. \nTrends in the United Kingdom and \nthe United States followed a similar \npattern. The rates in Brazil, on the \nother hand, appear to have reached \na peak in 1981 and may now be \ndeclining very slowly. In contrast, India, with rela -\ntively high rates of population growth, increasing \nmobility and growing numbers of vehicles, is still showing a rising trend in mortality rates.\n There are many factors contributing to these \ntrends and the differences between countries and \nregions. At the macro level, these trends have been \nsuccessfully modelled and used for predicting \nfuture developments.\nProjections and predictions\nWhile a decrease in deaths has been recorded in \nhigh-income countries, current and projected \ntrends in low-income and middle-income coun -\ntries foreshadow a large escalation in global road \ntrafﬁc mortality over the next 20 years and possi -\nbly beyond. Currently, there are two main models \nfor predicting future trends in road trafﬁc fatalities. \nThese two models are:\n— the WHO Global Burden of Disease (GBD) \nproject ( 8), using health data;\n— the World Bank’s Trafﬁc Fatalities and Eco -\nnomic Growth (TFEC) project ( 1), using trans -\nport, population and economic data.\n Both predict a substantial increase in road trafﬁc \ndeaths if present policies and actions in road safety \ncontinue and no additional road safety counter -\nmeasures are put into place. The GBD model pre -\ndicts the following scenario for 2020 compared \nwith 1990 ( 8):TABLE 2.4\nChanges in road trafﬁc fatality rates  \n(deaths per 10 000 population), 1975–1998\nCountry or area Change (%)\nCanada –63.4\nChina\n    Hong Kong SAR –61.7\n    Province of Taiwan –32.0\nSweden –58.3\nIsrael –49.7\nFrance –42.6\nNew Zealand –33.2\nUnited States of America –27.2\nJapan –24.5\nMalaysia   44.3\nIndia   79.3a\nSri Lanka   84.5\nLesotho 192.8\nColombia 237.1\nChina 243.0\nBotswana 383.8b\nSAR: Special Administrative Region.\na  Refers to the period 1980–1998.    \nb Refers to the period 1976–1998. \nSource: reproduced from reference 1, with minor editorial \namendments, with the permission of the authors.1960 1963 1966 1969 1972 1975 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002\nYearTraffic fatalities per 100 000 population\n05101520253035\nUnited KingdomAustralia\nUSAFIGURE 2.4\nRoad trafﬁc fatality trends in three high-income countries (Australia, \nUnited Kingdom, United States of America)\nSources: Transport Safety Bureau, Australia; Department of Transport; United Kingdom; \nFatality Analysis Reporting System, United States of America.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 60})","('type', 'Document')"

Other low-income and middle-income \ncountry rates may begin to decline earlier, but their \nfatality rates will still be higher than those experi -\nenced by high-income countries.\n The predicted percentage decrease in deaths \nfrom 2000 to 2020 for high-income countries of \n27% and the global increase of 67% in the TFEC \nmodel are similar to those of the GBD model. \nHowever, the models differ on the total number of \ndeaths each predicts for 2020. The TFEC model sug -\ngests that there will be 1.2 million deaths, as against \n2.4 million for the GBD model. To some extent, this \ndifference is explained by a much higher starting \nestimate for 1990 in the GBD model, which is based \non data from health facilities.\n The predictions need to be interpreted in con -\ntext. The international data presented in this report \nshow that at each income level, there are signiﬁ -\ncant differences among countries in the number \nof vehicles per capita and in fatalities per capita. \nThis implies that it is possible for people to live \nwith fewer vehicles per capita and fewer fatalities \nper capita than the average rates seen at present. \nProjected trends are based on the averages of past \ntrends. While existing scientiﬁc knowledge has not \nalways been easily accessible for most countries, \nefforts are now being made to collate and dissemi -\nnate this information so that it can be fed into pre -\ndictive models. It is feasible, therefore, that low-income and middle-income countries will not fol -\nlow the trends of the past and even that they could \nimprove upon them. As a result, the projections of \nthe World Bank and WHO may prove too high and \nlow-income and middle-income countries may see \nmuch lower death rates in the future. \n Both models have made a large number of \nassumptions about the future and are based on \nscarce and imperfect data. Moreover, models can -\nnot be expected to predict future reality precisely, \nas unforeseen factors will almost inevitably emerge. \nNevertheless, the underlying message from the \nprojections is clear: should current trends continue \nand no intensiﬁed and new interventions be imple -\nmented, then many more deaths and injuries will be \nexperienced from road trafﬁc crashes in the future. \nHelping low-income and middle-income countries \ntackle the problem of road trafﬁc injuries must be a \npriority, as these are the countries where the greatest \nincreases will occur in the next 20 years.\nMotorization, development and \nroad trafﬁc injury\nThe earlier discussion on estimates and trends has \nshown that the road trafﬁc injury problem is a \ncomplex one and represents the unfolding of many \nchanges and events, both economic and social. The \nintricate relationship between road trafﬁc injuries, \nmotor vehicle numbers and a country’s stage of devel -\nopment has been explored in a number of studies.

"('page_content', '40 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nThis section describes factors affecting trends in road \ntrafﬁc mortality rates, and, in particular, empirical \nﬁndings on the links between road trafﬁc fatalities, \nthe growth in the number of motor vehicles and \ndevelopment.\n The growth in the number of motor vehicles in \nvarious parts of the world is central, not only to \nroad safety, but also to other issues such as pollu -\ntion, the quality of life in urban and rural areas, the \ndepletion of natural resources, and social justice \n(15–20 ).\n As regards the number of fatalities, many high-\nincome countries in the ﬁrst half of the 20th cen -\ntury experienced a rapid growth in deaths from \nroad crashes, alongside economic growth and an \nincrease in the number of vehicles. During the \nsecond half of the century, though, many of these \ncountries saw reductions in fatality rates, despite \na continued rise in the number of motor vehicles \nand in mobility. It does not follow, therefore, that \na growth in mobility and motorization will neces -\nsarily lead to higher rates of fatalities.\n The ﬁrst signiﬁcant attempt to model the rela -\ntionship between fatality rates and motorization was \ncarried out by Smeed ( 21), who used data from 1938 \nfor 20 industrialized countries. Smeed came to the \nconclusion that fatalities per motor vehicle decreased \nwith an increasing number of vehicles per head of \npopulation. A similar relationship was later estab -\nlished for 32 developing countries, based on 1968 \ndata ( 22). This research led to a basic belief that the \nroad trafﬁc injury death rate per registered vehicle is \nexpected to decrease as the number of vehicles per \nhead of population increases. However, this model \nwas derived from a cross-section of countries and \nnot from a time series of data for one or more coun -\ntries. It is therefore dangerous to apply this model to \nchanges over time in a single country. Furthermore, \nthe use of the variable “fatalities per vehicle” has \nbeen criticized as an indicator for road trafﬁc safety. \nIt tends to ignore, for example, non-motorized \nforms of transport ( 23). Nor does it take into account \nother relevant road and environmental conditions, \nor the behaviour of drivers and other road users ( 24). \nThe use of appropriate indicators for road safety is \ndiscussed in more detail later in this chapter. Researchers have also investigated the rela -\ntionship between road trafﬁc injuries and other \nsocioeconomic indicators ( 1, 25–29 ). For instance, \nit is known that the mortality rate, especially that \nof infant mortality, tends to improve as the gross \nnational product (GNP) per capita increases. As a \nnation develops economically, it is to be expected \nthat part of the wealth generated will be devoted \nto efforts to reduce mortality, including road traf -\nﬁc mortality ( 27). In this context, mortality related \nto motor vehicles and road trafﬁc can be seen as a \n“disease of development”.\n A study of motor vehicle-related mortality in 46 \ncountries ( 27) established a direct but weak corre -\nlation between economic development – as meas -\nured by GNP per capita – and deaths per vehicle. \nThis relationship was found to be strongest among \ncountries with low GNP per capita, yet it was pre -\ncisely among these countries that the effects of \nfactors other than GNP per capita on fatalities per \nvehicle  were most important. Based on 1990 data, \nanother study established a positive relationship \nbetween GNP per capita and road trafﬁc mortality \nrates for 83 countries ( 29). In absolute terms, the \nmiddle-income countries had the highest mortal -\nity rates. When adjustments were made for the \nnumber of motor vehicles, the poorest countries \nshowed the highest road trafﬁc mortality rates.\n A recent World Bank report ( 1) examined data \nfrom 1963 to 1999 for 88 countries. Unlike Smeed’s \nresearch, the authors were able to develop models \nbased on time series data for each country. One of \ntheir main ﬁndings was a sharp increase in fatalities \nper head of population as gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita increased – but only at low levels \nof GDP per capita, up to a peak of between $6100 \nand $8600 (at 1985 international dollar values), \ndepending on the exact model. After that peak was \nreached, fatalities per head of population began to \ndecline. Their results also showed that fatalities per \nvehicle declined sharply with income per capita \nGDP in excess of $1180 (1985 international dollar \nvalues). The empirical results presented show the \nimportant contribution of economic development \nto mobility, which leads to increased motorization \nand increased exposure to risk.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 63})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 2.  THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 41\nProﬁle of people affected by road \ntrafﬁc injuries\nTypes of road user\nAlthough all types of road user are at risk of being \ninjured or killed in a road trafﬁc crash, there are \nnotable differences in fatality rates between \ndifferent road user groups. In particular, the \n“vulnerable” road users such as pedestrians and \ntwo-wheeler users are at greater risk than vehicle \noccupants and usually bear the greatest burden of \ninjury. This is especially true in low-income and \nmiddle-income countries, because of the greater \nvariety and intensity of trafﬁc mix and the lack of \nseparation from other road users. Of particular \nconcern is the mix between the slow-moving \nand vulnerable non-motorized road users, as \nwell as motorcycles, and fast-moving, motorized \nvehicles.\n Several studies have revealed marked differ -\nences in fatality rates between various groups of \nroad users, as well as between road users in high-\nincome countries and those in low-income and \nmiddle-income countries. A review of 38 studies \nfound that pedestrian fatalities were highest in 75% \nof the studies, accounting for between 41% and \n75% of all fatalities ( 30). Passengers were the sec -\nond largest group of road users killed, accounting for between 38% and 51% of fatalities. In Kenya, \nbetween 1971 and 1990, pedestrians represented \n42% of all crash fatalities; pedestrians and passen -\ngers combined accounted for approximately 80% \nof all fatalities in that country each year ( 31). In the \ncity of Nairobi, between 1977 and 1994, 64% of \nroad users killed in trafﬁc crashes were pedestrians \n(32).\n Recent studies have shown that pedestrians and \nmotorcyclists have the highest rates of injury in \nAsia ( 33–35 ). Injured pedestrians and passengers \nin mass transportation are the main issue in Africa \n(31, 36, 37 ). In Latin America and the Caribbean, \ninjuries to pedestrians are the greatest problem \n(38–40 ).\n By contrast, in most OECD countries, such as \nFrance, Germany and Sweden, car occupants repre -\nsent more than 60% of all fatalities, a reﬂection of \nthe greater number of motor vehicles in use. While \nthere are fewer motorcyclist, cyclist and pedestrian \ncasualties, these groups of road users bear higher \nfatality rates ( 41).\n In several low-income and middle-income \ncountries, passengers in buses and other informal \npublic transport systems also constitute a signiﬁ -\ncant group at high risk of road trafﬁc casualties ( 30) \n(see Box 2.1).\nBOX 2.1\nInformal types of transport\nPublic transport systems – such as buses, trains, underground trains and trams – are not well developed in many \nlow-income and middle-income countries. Instead, informal modes of transport, used largely by poorer people, \nhave evolved to ﬁll the gap, consisting of privately-owned buses, converted pick-up trucks and minibuses. Examples \ninclude the matatu  in Kenya, the light buses of Hong Kong and the minibuses of Singapore, Manila’s jeepneys , the \ncolt of Jakarta, the dolmus minibuses of Istanbul, the dala dala  of Tanzania, the tro-tro  of Ghana, the Haitian tap-\ntap, the molue  (locally known as “moving morgues”) and danfo  (“ﬂying cofﬁns”) in Nigeria, and the taxis of South \nAfrica and Uganda ( 10).\n The low fares charged by these forms of transport are affordable to poor people. The vehicles are also \nconvenient, as they will stop anywhere to pick up or drop off passengers, and they do not adhere to any ﬁxed \ntime schedules. Against these advantages for poorer people in terms of mobility, there is a marked lack of safety. \nThe vehicles are generally overloaded with passengers and goods. The drivers speed, are aggressive in their road \nbehaviour and lack respect for other road users. The long hours that drivers are forced to work result in fatigue, \nsleep deprivation and reckless driving ( 42).')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 64})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '42 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nBOX 2.1 (continued)\n These forms of transport thus present a real dilemma for road transport planners. On the one hand, the people \nwho use them lack alternative safe and affordable public transport. These types of transport provide employment \nfor poor people, and it is difﬁcult to prohibit them. On the other hand, they are inherently dangerous. The drivers, \nsubject to all-powerful vehicle owners, are not protected by labour laws. The owners frequently have their own \nprivate arrangements with the trafﬁc enforcement authorities. All these factors increase the risk of vehicle crashes \nand injuries, and complicate possibilities for intervention.\n All the same, a strategy must be found to regulate this industry and make it into a safe and organized form of \npublic transport. Such a strategy must address the safety of road users, the labour rights of drivers and the economic \ninterests of the vehicle owners ( 10, 42, 43 ). One possibility is that vehicle owners could be encouraged to pool their \nresources through some form of joint venture and be given access to additional capital and management capacity, so \nthat a safe and effectively-regulated public transport system could be developed.\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 9 0 100\nPercentageNetherlandsJapan\nNorwayAustralia\nUSAMalaysi a\nThailandColombo, Sri LankaBandung, Indonesi aDelhi, Indi a\nPedestrians Cyclists Motorized two-wheelers Motorized four -wheelers OtherFIGURE 2.7\nRoad users killed in various modes of transport as a proportion of all \nroad trafﬁc deaths\nSource: reference 44.

In Asia alone, bicycles carry \nmore people than do all the world’s cars. Nonetheless, in many countries, bicycle injuries are not given proper \nrecognition as a road safety problem and attract little research ( 45).\n In Beijing, China, about a third of all trafﬁc deaths occur among bicyclists ( 46). In India, bicyclists represent \nbetween 12% and 21% of road user fatalities, the second-largest category after pedestrians ( 47). \n China is one of the few developing countries where public policy until recently has encouraged the use of bicycles \nas a form of commuting. In the city of Tianjin, 77% of all daily passenger trips are taken by bicycle – compared, for \ninstance, with just 1% in Sydney, Australia ( 48). There are estimated to be over 300 million bicycles in all of China. \nWhile about one in four people in China owns a bicycle, only 1 in 74 000 owns a car ( 45). Use of bicycle helmets in \nChina is rare, though. In the city of Wuhan, for instance, their use is non-existent, despite the fact that 45% of all \ntrafﬁc deaths in the city occur among bicyclists ( 49).\nReducing bicycle injuries\nTo reduce bicycle injuries – in China, as elsewhere – several types of intervention are likely to be effective. \nChanges to the road environment can be highly beneﬁcial. They include:\n— separating bicycles from other forms of trafﬁc;\n— engineering measures to control trafﬁc ﬂow and reinforce low speeds;\n— bicycle lanes;\n— trafﬁc signals and signs aimed at bicyclists;\n— painted lines on the side of the road;\n— removing obstacles from roads and cycle paths;\n— creating clear lines of sight;\n— repairing road surfaces, to remove pot-holes and dangerous curbs.\nMeasures involving changes in personal behaviour include:\n— use of a bicycle helmet;\n— safe bicycling practices;\n— respectful behaviour towards others sharing the road.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 66})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '44 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nOccupational road trafﬁc injuries\nMotor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of \ndeath in the workplace in the United States, and \ncontribute substantially to the road fatality bur -\nden in other industrialized nations. In the United \nStates, an average of 2100 workers died from motor \nvehicle crashes each year between 1992 and 2001, \naccounting for 35% of all workplace fatalities in \nthat country, and representing slightly over 3% \nof the total road crash fatalities (S. Pratt, personal \ncommunication, 2003) ( 51).\n In the European Union, road trafﬁc and transport \ncrashes at work account for an even greater proportion \nof workplace fatalities – around 41% in 1999 ( 52). In \nAustralia, the experience is similar, with nearly half \nof all workplace fatalities between 1989 and 1992 \nassociated with either driving for work or commut -\ning between home and the workplace. Work-related \ncrashes were estimated to comprise 13% of all road \nfatalities ( 53). Data for Australia, however, differ from \nthose for the European Union and the United States \nin that work-related crashes include those that occur \nduring commuting to and from work in addition to \ndriving during the workday. Data \non work-related road trafﬁc crashes \nin low-income and middle-income \ncountries are scant.\nSex and age\nThe distribution of road trafﬁc \nmortality rates by sex and age, \nglobally, as well as for each WHO \nregion, is shown in the Statisti -\ncal Annex, Table A.2. Over 50% \nof the global mortality due to \nroad trafﬁc injury occurs among young adults aged between 15 and 44 years ( 54), \nand the rates for this age group are higher in low-\nincome and middle-income countries. In 2002, \nmales accounted for 73% of all road trafﬁc deaths, \nwith an overall rate almost three times that for \nfemales: 27.6 per 100 000 population and 10.4 per \n100 000 population, respectively. Road trafﬁc mor -\ntality rates are higher in men than in women in all \nregions regardless of income level, and also across \nall age groups (Figure 2.8). On average, males in \nthe low-income and middle-income countries of \nthe WHO Africa Region and the WHO Eastern \nMediterranean Region have the highest road traf -\nﬁc injury mortality rates worldwide (see Statistical \nAnnex, Table A.2). The gender difference in mor -\ntality rates is probably related to both exposure and \nrisk-taking behaviour.\n Table 2.7 shows the burden of road trafﬁc inju -\nries in terms of DALYs by sex. Morbidity rates \nfor males are considerably higher than those for \nfemales. Furthermore, about 60% of the DALYs \nlost globally as a result of road trafﬁc injury occurs \namong adults aged between 15 and 44 years ( 54).BOX 2.2 (continued)\nLegislative and related measures that can be effective include:\n� laws mandating helmet use;\n� strict legal limits on alcohol use while bicycling;\n� speed restrictions;\n� enforcement of trafﬁc laws.\nIntroducing a package of all these approaches is likely to be more effective than if they are used singly, and promises \nin all countries to signiﬁcantly reduce the toll of bicycle-related injuries.\nTABLE 2.7\nRoad trafﬁc injury burden (DALYs lost) by WHO region and sex, 2002\nWHO region Males Females Total\nAll 27 057 385 11 368 958 38 426 342\nAfrican Region 4 665 446 2 392 812 7 058 257\nRegion of the Americas 3 109 183 1 141 861 4 251 044\nSouth-East Asia Region 7 174 901 2 856 994 10 031 894\nEuropean Region 2 672 506 937 945 3 610 451\nEastern Mediterranean Region 3 173 548 1 403 037 4 576 585\nWestern Paciﬁc Region 6 261 800 2 636 309 8 898 110\nDALYs: Disability-adjusted life years.\nSource: WHO Global Burden of Disease project, 2002, Version 1 (see Statistical Annex).')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 67})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 2.  THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 45\n As expected, when analysed by country, road traf -\nﬁc injury mortality rates are again substantially higher \namong males than among females. El Salvador’s road \ntrafﬁc fatality rate for males, for instance, is 58.1 \nper 100 000, compared with 13.6 per 100 000 for \nfemales (see Statistical Annex, Table A.4). In Latvia, \nthere is a similar gender difference, with a rate of \n42.7 per 100 000 for men and 11.4 per 100 000 for \nfemales. Certain factors in some countries give rise \nto an even greater gap between the genders; females \nmay be excluded as drivers or passengers, and in gen -\neral may face less exposure to road trafﬁc crash risk \nfor cultural or economic reasons.\n A comprehensive review of 46 studies in low-income and middle-income countries found that, \nin terms of involvement in road trafﬁc crashes, \nthere was a consistent predominance of males over \nfemales; males were involved in a mean of 80% of \ncrashes, and 87% of drivers were male ( 30). Recent \nstudies from China, Colombia, Ghana, Kenya, \nMexico, Mozambique, the Republic of Korea, Thai -\nland, Trinidad and Tobago, Viet Nam and Zambia all \nindicate greater rates of male as opposed to female \ninvolvement in road trafﬁc collisions ( 55).\n According to WHO data, adults aged between \n15 and 44 years account for more than 50% of \nall road trafﬁc deaths.

Children are especially vulnerable, as their physical and cognitive \nskills are not fully developed and their smaller stature makes it hard for them to see and to be seen. Societies are \nconcerned about the basic safety of their children.\n Road trauma is a leading cause of injury to children. In high-income countries, child injury and road deaths \nrose sharply with motorization in the 1950s and 1960s. While many of these countries have had great success in \nprevention, road trafﬁc crashes remain a leading cause of death and injury for children. In low-income and middle-\nincome countries, child deaths and injuries are rising as the number of vehicles increases.\n According to WHO estimates for 2002, there were 180 500 children killed as the result of road crashes. Some 97% \nof these child road deaths occurred in low-income and middle-income countries.\n The level and pattern of child road injury is linked to differences in road use. In Africa, children are more likely \nto be hurt as pedestrians and as users of public transport.

"('page_content', '46 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n Around the world, 193 478 older persons (aged 60 \nyears and above) died in 2002 as a result of road trafﬁc \ncrashes; this ﬁgure is equivalent to 16% of the global \ntotal (see Statistical Annex, Table A.2 and Box 2.4).\n In some countries, the over-60 years age group \naccounts for a higher proportion of all road trafﬁc \ndeaths than the global average. A study conducted \nin 1998 in the United Kingdom found that 25.4% of \nall road trafﬁc fatalities were people aged 60 years or \nabove. In terms of distribution by road user group, \n46.6% of pedestrian fatalities and 53% of bus pas -\nsenger fatalities were people aged 60 years and above. \nExcept for bicyclists, this age group was overrepre -\nsented in all categories of road trafﬁc fatalities ( 61). \nThe OECD ( 62) found that in 1997 , pedestrian fatalities \namong those aged 65 years and above were lowest in \nthe Netherlands (5.5% of all road trafﬁc fatalities) and \nhighest in Norway (49%) and the United Kingdom \n(48.8%).\n Qatar and the United Arab Emirates both display \nhigh mortality rates among the over-60 years age \ngroup. In Qatar, males over 60 years had a road traf -\nﬁc fatality rate more than twice that of those in the \n15–29 years age group (110 per 100 000, against \n48 per 100 000) ( 63). In the United Arab Emirates, \nthe rates were lower but the difference between age \ngroups was more marked: 29 per 100 000 for those \naged 15–44 years and 91 per 100 000 for those aged \n60 years or above ( 64).\n No speciﬁc studies on older persons and road trafﬁc \ninjuries in low-income and middle-income countries could be found. However, results of a study on adult \npedestrian trafﬁc trauma in Cape Town, South Africa, \nfound that only 18% of persons involved in collisions \nwere aged 60 years or above ( 65).\nSocioeconomic status and location\nSocioeconomic status is well known to be a risk \nfactor for injury generally, and road trafﬁc injury \nis no exception ( 10, 42, 66–68 ). Studies have found \nthat individuals from disadvantaged socioeconomic \ngroups or living in poorer areas are at greatest risk \nof being killed or injured as a result of a road trafﬁc \ncrash, even in high-income countries. The evidence \nsuggests that explanations for these differences should \nbe sought in variations in exposure to risk, rather than \nin behaviour ( 67), though behavioural differences do \nplay some role. Even in industrialized countries, road \ntrafﬁc injuries as a cause of mortality have the steepest \nsocial class gradient, particularly in the case of chil -\ndren and young adults ( 67 , 69 ).\n There are several indicators that are widely used to \nassess socioeconomic status, educational and occupa -\ntional level being two of the most common. In a New \nZealand cohort study conducted in the 1990s, it was \nfound that drivers with low-status occupations and \nlower levels of education had a higher risk of injury, \neven when adjusting for confounding variables such \nas driving exposure levels ( 70). In Sweden, the risk of \ninjury for pedestrians and bicyclists was between 20% \nand 30% higher among the children of manual work -\ners than those of higher-salaried employees ( 67).BOX 2.3 (continued)\n The burden of injury is unequal. More boys are injured than girls, and children from poorer families have higher \nrates of injury. Even in high-income countries, research has shown that children from poorer families and ethnic \nminority groups have higher rates of unintentional injury, particularly in the case of child pedestrians.\n Many countries have made substantial improvements in child road safety. In Australia, for example, in the 25 \nyears after 1970, the road fatality rate per 100 000 children fell by 60% ( 56).\n Interventions that have done much to reduce child trafﬁc injuries and deaths include:\n— the development, promotion and increasing use of speciﬁcally-designed child restraints;\n— improvements in the road environment that have reduced the number of child pedestrian injuries, since \nthese injuries are associated with trafﬁc volume and trafﬁc speed ( 57);\n— increased use of bicycle helmets, that has been associated with a reduction in head injuries among children.\n The success, though, of prevention efforts in child road injury is not uniform, and much remains to be done.\nAs noted by Deal et al. ( 58), “Injuries, both violent and intentional, are one of the most signiﬁcant public health \nissues facing children today, but public outrage is absent. As a result, proven solutions go unused, and thousands \nof children die each year.”')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 69})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 2.  THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 47\n The choice of transport in developing coun -\ntries is often inﬂuenced by socioeconomic factors, \nespecially income. In Kenya, for example, 27% of \ncommuters who had had no formal education were \nfound to travel on foot, 55% used buses or mini -\nbuses and 8% travelled in private cars. By contrast, \n81% of those with secondary-level education usu -\nally travelled in private cars, 19% by bus and none \nwalked ( 43).\n In many countries, road trafﬁc crashes are more \nfrequent in urban areas, particularly as urbaniza -\ntion increases. However, injury severity is gener -\nally greater in rural areas. This could be related to \nroad design and congestion in urban areas slow -\ning trafﬁc, while conditions in rural areas allow \nfor travelling at greater speeds. In low-income and \nmiddle-income countries, fewer crashes happen in rural areas, but the overall costs to the families \ncan be greater when they do occur ( 71). In many \ncountries there is concern over the vulnerability of \npeople living along highways, since these roads are \noften built through areas where economic activity \nalready exists, thus creating potential conﬂicts over \nspace between the road users and the local popula -\ntion ( 55).\nOther health, social and economic \nimpacts\nEstimating the cost to society of road crashes is \nimportant for several reasons. First, it is essential for \nraising awareness of the seriousness of road crashes \nas a social problem, Second, it serves to make \nproper comparisons between road trafﬁc crashes \nand other causes of death and injury. Third, since BOX 2.4\nOlder people and road trafﬁc injury\nFrom a public health point of view, the most serious problem facing the elderly relates to the fact that their mobility \nout of doors may be restricted because the transport system has failed to meet their needs. Safety issues tend to be \na secondary issue.\n Road trafﬁc injuries are not a major cause of death for the elderly. However, relative to their proportion of the \noverall population, older people are often overrepresented in trafﬁc fatalities, especially as vulnerable road users. \nOlder pedestrians in particular are associated with a very high rate of road injury and death. This is mainly due to the \nincreased physical frailty of the elderly. Given the same type of impact, an older person is more likely to be injured or \nkilled than a younger one.\n Because of the mobility it provides, private car travel can be more important for the elderly than for those in \nother age groups. Many people continue to drive vehicles until they are very old. For some, driving may be their only \noption for mobility, since certain illnesses can affect their ability to walk or to use public transport before affecting \ntheir ability to drive.\n There is a widespread misconception that older drivers are a threat to trafﬁc safety. Generally speaking, older \ndrivers have the lowest crash rates of all age groups, but because of their frailty, have higher injury and fatality rates \n(59, 60 ). Their injury rates may also be affected by diseases such as osteoporosis, impaired homeostasis and poor tissue \nelasticity.\n Older drivers face different types of crashes than younger ones. They experience relatively more crashes in \ncomplex trafﬁc situations, such as at intersections, and relatively fewer through lack of caution, such as through \nspeeding or careless overtaking. Injury patterns also differ, partly because of differences in the nature of collisions, \nwith older people suffering more fatal chest injuries, for instance, than younger drivers.\n Recent studies on ageing and transport have highlighted pedestrian safety as the main safety concern for the \nelderly. These studies have indicated that if good quality door-to-door public transport is not available for the elderly, \nthen the use of private cars remains their safest option for getting around. While it is accepted that certain groups of \nolder drivers should not drive – such as those suffering from advanced forms of dementia – mandatory screening of \ndrivers based on age is not recommended. Improvements in pedestrian infrastructure, and interventions to support \nsafe driving as long as possible for older people, are generally regarded as better investments for their safety and \nmobility than attempts to stop them from driving.

"('page_content', '48 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nthe social cost of road trafﬁc crashes is a reﬂection \nof the social beneﬁts of reducing crashes through \nsafety interventions, scientiﬁc assessments of the \ncosts enables priorities between different interven -\ntions to be made, using cost–beneﬁt methods.\n Assessment of road trafﬁc injury costs can be car -\nried out with methods that are well known in the \nhealth valuation literature. Though the costs to soci -\nety – such as lost productivity and economic oppor -\ntunity, and diverted institutional resources – can be \nestimated in economic terms, valuing the suffering \nand loss of life associated with road trafﬁc injuries \nis difﬁcult and often contentious. Accordingly, some \nstudies measure what people would pay – referred \nto as their “willingness to pay”– to reduce the risk \nof a fatal or non-fatal injury. Another method is to \nequate the loss of life through trafﬁc crashes with \nlost earnings. This is known as the “human capital” \napproach. In any case, the social cost of an injury or \npremature death should at least include the associ -\nated costs of medical treatment – the direct costs of \nillness – as well as the loss in productivity associ -\nated with the death or injury – the indirect costs \nof illness. The costs of medical treatment normally \ninclude emergency treatment, initial medical costs, \nand, for serious injuries, the costs of long-term \ncare and rehabilitation. Productivity losses include \nthe value of lost household services and the value \nof lost earnings for the victim, caregivers and fam -\nily. In practice, many analyses of the costs of trafﬁc \ncrashes, especially those in developing countries, \nuse lost productivity, rather than willingness-to-pay, \nto value injury and death.\n Industrialized countries regularly produce annual \nestimates of the overall cost of road trafﬁc crashes. \nThese estimates include the cost of injuries and \nfatalities sustained in crashes and the cost of damage \nto property, as well as administrative costs associ -\nated with crashes, such as legal expenses and the \ncosts of administering insurance, and the value of \nthe delays in travel caused by crashes. Of all of these \ncosts, those of injuries and fatalities are perhaps \nthe most difﬁcult to value. Medical and rehabilita -\ntion costs can be prohibitively expensive and often \ncontinue for an indeﬁnite time, particularly in the \ncase of serious road trafﬁc disabilities. Though most attention is usually focused on fatalities, injuries and \ntheir ensuing disabilities take an unexpectedly costly \ntoll.\n Some major gaps exist in the research on the \nhealth and socioeconomic impacts of road traf -\nﬁc injuries. First, existing analyses of costs do \nnot address particularly well those costs related \nto psychosocial issues, such as pain and suffer -\ning. Second, there is a lack of good international \nstandards for predicting and measuring disability. \nIn addition, there are far fewer studies of the cost \nof trafﬁc crashes in developing countries than else -\nwhere. One reason for this is the scarcity of reliable \ndata on the number and nature of crashes.\nHealth and social impacts\nInjuries sustained by victims of a road trafﬁc crash \nvary in type and severity. Data from the GBD 2002 \nproject show that almost a quarter of those injured \nseverely enough to require admission to a health facil -\nity sustain a traumatic brain injury; 10% suffer open \nwounds, such as lacerations, and nearly 20% expe -\nrience fractures to the lower limbs (see Table 2.8). \nStudies in both developed and developing countries \nhave found that motor vehicle crashes are the leading \ncause of traumatic brain injury ( 65, 72–76 ).\n A review of studies in low-income and middle-\nincome countries ( 30) revealed that road trafﬁc-\nrelated injury accounted for between 30% and 86% \nof trauma admissions in these countries. Eleven of \nthe 15 studies that included data on hospital uti -\nlization examined the length of stay. The overall \nmean length of stay was 20 days, ranging from \n3.8 days in Jordan to 44.6 days in Sharjah, United \nArab Emirates. Patients who sustained spinal injury \nhad the longest duration of hospital stay.\n The review further found the following:\n• Road trafﬁc injury patients comprised between \n13% and 31% of all injury-related attendees in \nhospitals.\n• Road trafﬁc injury patients represented 48% \nof bed occupancy in surgical wards in some \ncountries.\n• Road trafﬁc injury patients were the most fre -\nquent users of operating theatres and intensive \ncare units.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 71})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 2.  THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 49\n• Increased workloads in X-ray departments \nand increased demands for physiotherapy and \nrehabilitation services were, to a large extent, \nattributable to road trafﬁc crashes.\n Individual country studies report similar ﬁndings. \nFor instance, out of a total of 2913 trauma patients \nwho had attended the University of Ilorin teaching \nhospital in Nigeria over a period of 15 months, 1816, \nor 62.3%, had suffered road trafﬁc injuries ( 77). In \nKenya, a survey on the perceived capacity of health \ncare facilities to handle more than 10 injured per -\nsons simultaneously, showed that only 40% of \nhealth administrators thought that their facilities \nwere well prepared. Of the hospitals that were least \nprepared, 74% were public hospitals – the facilities \nthat poor people use most frequently ( 43). \n The results of a study in the United States ( 78) \nrevealed that 5.27 million people had sustained non-fatal road trafﬁc injuries in \n2000, 87% of which were con -\nsidered “minor”, according to the \nmaximum injury severity scale. \nThese injuries resulted in medi -\ncal costs of US$ 31.7 billion, plac -\ning a huge burden on health care \nservices and individual ﬁnances. \nIn terms of unit medical costs per \ninjury level, the most severe level \nof injury – MAIS 5, that includes \nhead and spinal cord injury – cost \nby far the largest amount, at US$ \n332 457 per injury, exceeding the \ncombined cost per unit of all other \ninjuries, including fatalities.\n Injured people often suf -\nfer physical pain and emotional \nanguish that is beyond any eco -\nnomic compensation. Permanent \ndisability, such as paraplegia, \nquadriplegia, loss of eyesight, \nor brain damage, can deprive \nan individual of the ability to \nachieve even minor goals and \nresult in dependence on others \nfor economic support and routine \nphysical care. Less serious – but \nmore common – injuries to ankles, knees and the \ncervical spine can result in chronic physical pain \nand limit an injured person’s physical activity for \nlengthy periods. Serious burns, contusions and lac -\nerations can lead to emotional trauma associated \nwith permanent disﬁgurement ( 79).\nPsychosocial impact\nMedical costs and lost productivity do not capture \nthe psychosocial losses associated with road trafﬁc \ncrashes, either to those injured or to their families. \nThese costs might possibly exceed the productivity \nlosses and medical costs associated with premature \ndeath, were they accurately quantiﬁable. A study \nconducted in Sweden showed that there was a high \nrate of psychosocial complications following road \ntrafﬁc crashes, even for minor injuries.

Of those \nemployed, 16% could not return to their ordinary \njobs, while a third reported a reduction in leisure-\ntime activities ( 80).\n Road trafﬁc crashes can place a heavy burden on \nthe family and friends of the injured person, many \nof whom also experience adverse social, physical \nand psychological effects, in the short-term or long-\nterm. In the European Union, more than 40 000 \npeople are killed and more than 150 000 disabled \nfor life by road trafﬁc crashes each year. As a result, \nnearly 200 000 families annually are newly bereaved \nor have family members disabled for life ( 81). In a \nstudy on how families and communities cope with \ninjured relatives, the most frequently reported cop -\ning strategy was reallocation of work within the \nfamily, with at least one family member having to \ntake time off from their usual activity to help the \ninjured person or to carry on that person’s work. As \na result of individuals changing their work patterns \nfor this reason, about a third of them lost income. In \nsome cases, the injury of a family member caused \nchildren to stay away from school ( 82).\n The Fédération Européenne des Victimes de la \nRoute (FEVR) conducted a comprehensive study in \nEurope of the physical, psychological and material \ndamage suffered by victims and their families sub -\nsequent to road crashes ( 83). The results showed \nthat 90% of the families of those killed and 85% of \nthe families of those disabled reported a signiﬁcant \npermanent decline in their quality of life, and in \nhalf of the cases the consequences were especially \nsevere. In a follow-up study, FEVR sought to deter -\nmine the causes of this decline. Most of the victims \nor their relatives suffered from headaches, sleep -\ning problems, disturbing nightmares and general \nhealth problems. Three years after the incident, \nthese complaints had not signiﬁcantly decreased \n(84). In addition, it was found that victims and \ntheir families were often dissatisﬁed with such \nmatters as criminal proceedings, insurance and \ncivil claims, and the level of support and informa -\ntion received on legal rights and other issues ( 84).\n The psychological and social consequences of \nroad trafﬁc trauma are not always directly propor -tional to the severity of the physical injury; even rela -\ntively minor injuries can have profound psychosocial \neffects. Nearly a ﬁfth of those injured, according to \none study, developed an acute stress reaction and a \nquarter displayed psychiatric problems within the \nﬁrst year. Long-term psychiatric problems consisted \nmainly of mood disorder (in around 10% of cases), \nphobic travel anxiety (20%) and post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (11%). Phobic travel disorder was frequent \namong drivers and passengers ( 85).\nOther consequences\nIn a recent study, 55% of those attending an accident \nand emergency unit following a road trafﬁc crash \nreported signiﬁcant medical, psychiatric, social or legal \nconsequences one year later. Many patients with less \nserious or no injuries still suffered long-term health \nand other problems not necessarily related to their \ninjury. Furthermore, reports of continuing physi -\ncal problems one year on, largely musculoskeletal in \nnature, were considerably more common than would \nbe expected from the nature of injuries sustained ( 86).\n Pedestrians and motorcyclists suffer the most \nsevere injuries as a result of motor vehicle collisions, \nreport more continuing medical problems and require \nmore assistance, compared with other types of road \nuser. There are few psychological or social differences, \nhowever, between different road users ( 87).\n In many low-income and middle-income coun -\ntries, and sometimes in high-income countries as \nwell, the cost of prolonged care, the loss of the \nprimary breadwinner, funeral costs, and the loss \nof income due to disability, can push a family into \npoverty ( 10, 38 ). The process of impoverishment can \naffect children especially strongly. The second lead -\ning cause of orphaned children in Mexico is the loss \nof parents as a result of road trafﬁc crashes ( 38).\n Other consequential effects of transport and \nmotorization on the environment and health are \ndealt with more comprehensively in recent WHO \ndocuments ( 88, 89 ).\nEconomic impact\nAs part of the recent review undertaken by the \nUnited Kingdom-based TRL Ltd on the number \nof road trafﬁc collisions globally, information on ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 73})","('type', 'Document')"

This study found \nthat the average annual cost of road crashes was \nabout 1% of GNP in developing countries, 1.5% in \ncountries in economic transition and 2% in highly-\nmotorized countries (see Table 2.9). According to \nthis study, the annual burden of economic costs glo -\nbally is estimated at around US$ 518 billion. On a \ncountry basis, the economic burdens are estimated \nto represent proportions of GNP ranging from 0.3% \nin Viet Nam to almost 5% in Malawi and in Kwa -\nZulu-Natal, South Africa ( 2), with a few countries \nregistering even higher percentages. In most coun -\ntries, though, the costs exceed 1% of GNP.\n The total annual costs of road crashes to low-\nincome and middle-income countries are estimated \nto be about US$ 65 billion, exceeding the total \nannual amount received in development assistance \n(2). These costs are especially damaging for countries \nstruggling with the problems of development. In the \nhigh-income countries of the European Union, it has \nbeen estimated that the cost of road crashes each year \nexceeds €180 billion – twice the European Union \nannual budget for all of its activities ( 90, 91 ).\n A study carried out in the United States, using \nthe human capital – or lost productivity – approach, \nestimated the national economic costs of road trafﬁc \ncrashes at US$ 230.6 billion, or 2.3% of GDP ( 78).

Property \ndamage represents around 16% of the total for Esto -\nnia and 17% for Latvia and Lithuania ( 79).\n Using the notion of, “potentially productive \nyears of life lost”, injuries in 1999 cost China 12.6 \nmillion years, more than any other disease group. \nThe estimated annual economic cost of injury in \nChina is equivalent to US$ 12.5 billion – almost \nfour times the total public health services budget \nfor the country and a productivity loss that more \nthan offsets the total productivity gains of new \nentrants to the labour force each year. Motor vehi -\ncle fatalities alone accounted for 25% of the total \nnumber of potentially productive years of life lost \nfrom all injury deaths, with their potential impact \non economic development being particularly acute \nin rural areas ( 99).\n The most productive age group, those aged \nbetween 15 and 44 years, is heavily represented \nin road trafﬁc injuries; the economic impacts of \ninjuries in this age group are therefore especially \ndamaging. According to WHO, injuries to indi -\nviduals in this age group, “tend to affect productiv -\nity severely, particularly among the lowest-income \ngroups whose exposure to risk is greatest and \nwhose earning capacity is most likely to rely on \nphysical activity” ( 100). The incidence of road \ntrafﬁc crashes in Kenya illustrates this point; more \nthan 75% of road trafﬁc casualties are among eco -\nnomically productive young adults ( 30).\n A case study conducted in Bangladesh found that \npoor families were more likely than those better \noff to lose their head of household and thus suf -\nfer immediate economic effects as a result of road \ntrafﬁc injuries. The loss of earnings, together with \nmedical bills, funeral costs and legal bills, can have \na ruinous effect on a family’s ﬁnances. Among the \npoor, 32% of the road deaths surveyed occurred \nto a head of household or that head’s spouse, \ncompared with 21% among those not deﬁned as \npoor.

Recently, a number of \nlow-income and middle-income countries have set \nup systems to monitor injuries, including road traf -ﬁc injuries. Examples include Colombia (C. Clavel-\nArcas, unpublished observations, 2003), El Salvador \n(C. Clavel-Arcas, unpublished observations, 2003), \nEthiopia ( 105), Ghana ( 106), Jamaica ( 107), Mozam -\nbique ( 105), Nicaragua (C. Clavel-Arcas, unpublished \nobservations, 2003), South Africa ( 108), Thailand \n(109) and Uganda ( 110) (see Box 2.5).\nBOX 2.5\nThe national injury surveillance system in Thailand\nThailand’s provincial injury surveillance system started in 1993. Its objectives were to establish a database to evaluate, \nat a provincial level, the quality of acute trauma care and the referral services provided to the injured, and to improve \ninjury prevention and control at both local and national levels ( 109). Previously, data providers in hospitals had not \nbeen responsible for information on road trafﬁc crashes at a provincial level. Existing information systems were \npoorly designed and managed, not computerized, and not standardized as regards deﬁnitions, sources of data and \nmethods of data collection. Consequently, regional or national comparisons were impossible ( 109).\n A trauma registry system had been developed in the large provincial hospital in Khon Kaen. This system was chosen \nas the prototype for the new surveillance system, because of its achievements over eight years in injury prevention \nand improving the quality of acute care ( 111). The Noncommunicable Diseases Epidemiology Section of the Ministry \nof Public Health revised the hospital’s trauma registry form and set up appropriate reporting criteria, deﬁnitions of \nterms and methods of coding. Appropriate computer software for processing the data was developed. The hospital \nproduced manuals and ran training courses to help personnel operate the surveillance system effectively ( 109).\n In January 1995, a provincial injury surveillance system was established in ﬁve sentinel hospitals, one in Bangkok \nand four in other regions of Thailand. Each was a large general hospital with a sufﬁcient number of injuries and mix \nof cases, receiving referrals from other local hospitals ( 109).\n All those acutely injured within seven days before admittance, including those who had died, were included in \nthe surveillance system. Data were forwarded every six months by the local authorities to the central coordinating \nunit in the Epidemiology Division of the Ministry of Public Health.\n Within six months, it had become clear that trafﬁc injuries were the most important cause of injury in each \nsentinel hospital. The epidemiology of other major causes of injuries was also investigated, and the quality of pre-\nhospital service and of inter-hospital transfers was monitored. Information obtained was fed into the eighth ﬁve-year \nNational Health Development Plan ( 112).\n Data on alcohol-related trafﬁc injuries were instrumental in the introduction of obligatory warnings on the \nlabels of alcoholic beverages and of other interventions against drink-driving. The surveillance reports were sent to \npolicy-makers in a range of sectors, including parliamentarians and governors of the provinces in which the sentinel \nhospitals were located – as well as to police departments and the mass media ( 109, 76 ).\n Although the extra workload arising from the surveillance activities created problems in the sentinel hospitals, \nthe advantages of the scheme were such that 20 more hospitals voluntarily joined the surveillance network \n(76). Simpliﬁcations to the system were subsequently made, though, to reduce the workload on medical records \ndepartments, so that the sentinel hospitals were required to report only cases of severe injury, including:\n— deaths before arrival;\n— deaths in the emergency department;\n— observed or admitted injury cases.\nThis caused only minor changes in ranking among the top ﬁve leading causes of injury ( 76).\n In January 2001, Thailand’s National Injury Surveillance was ofﬁcially launched. By 2003, the national network had \ngrown to include 28 large hospitals, as well as almost 60 general hospitals and one university hospital. The system is \none of only a few injury surveillance systems in low-income and middle-income countries that operate nationally and \ninvolve a model that WHO recognizes and encourages for technology transfer between countries.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 77})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 2.  THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 55\n In addition to country-speciﬁc information \nsystems, a number of regional systems exist. Coun -\ntries belonging to the OECD support and make use \nof the International Road Trafﬁc Accident Database \n(IRTAD), to which they submit standardized crash \nand injury data, together with some basic transport \nstatistics and other safety-related information ( 13). \nThe United Nations Economic and Social Com -\nmission for Asia and the Paciﬁc has developed a \nregional road crash database known as the Asia-\nPaciﬁc Road Accident Database ( 113) which, like \nIRTAD, requires countries in the region to submit \ndata in a standard format. The Caribbean Epidemi -\nology Centre has introduced an injury surveillance \nsystem in the Bahamas, Barbados, and Trinidad and \nTobago ( 114).\n Europe has its own regional system, known as \nCARE – Community Database on Accidents on the \nRoads in Europe – which differs from the above-\nmentioned systems in that country returns are \nmandatory. However, the system allows countries \nto make returns in their own national formats \nand it includes disaggregated data on individual \ncrashes. After being received, the data are adjusted \nfor variations in deﬁnitions. To this end, a number \nof correction factors have been developed ( 115).\n International and regional guidelines are avail -\nable on crash and injury information systems to \nhelp countries decide on which data to collect. For \nexample, in the transport sector, the Association of \nSouth East Asia Nations has developed road safety \nguidelines that include advice on what information \nis required ( 116). The WHO guidelines for devel -\noping and implementing injury surveillance sys -\ntems in hospital settings contain recommendations \non the core minimum data set and supplementary \ndata that should be collected on all injury patients, \nincluding road trafﬁc casualties ( 101).\nCommunity-based surveys\nA second approach to gathering data on road trafﬁc \ninjuries is to conduct community-based surveys. \nSome injured patients fail to reach hospital for \na variety of reasons, in which case they will not \nbe captured by hospital-based injury surveillance \nsystems. Community-based surveys not only pick up these otherwise unreported cases, but also pro -\nvide useful information on injuries and may be of \nparticular relevance in countries where basic pop -\nulation and mortality data are not available ( 102). \nCommunity surveys have been recently conducted \nin Ghana ( 117), India ( 118), Pakistan ( 119), South \nAfrica ( 120), Uganda ( 121) and Viet Nam ( 122). \nThese surveys, though, require methodological \nexpertise which may not be widely available. To \nthis end, WHO is currently developing Guidelines for \nconducting community surveys on injuries and violence , which \nwill provide a standardized methodology for carry -\ning out such studies ( 102).\nSurveys on selected themes\nA third approach is to conduct surveys on par -\nticular themes related to road trafﬁc injuries and \ntransport. Examples are road user surveys, road -\nside surveys, origin–destination surveys, pedes -\ntrian surveys, cyclist surveys and speed surveys \n– as well as studies on such issues as alcohol use \nand the cost of crashes. These surveys may arise \nfrom the need for speciﬁc data that are not avail -\nable from hospital-based surveillance systems or \ncommunity surveys.\nData linkages\nAs shown in Table 2.10, road trafﬁc injury data and \nevidence is collected and stored by a range of agen -\ncies. This is in itself a positive feature, as it reﬂects \nthe multisectoral nature of the phenomenon. \nHowever, it also raises important issues to do with \naccess, harmonization and linkages between differ -\nent data sources and users. Ideally, where there are \na number of data sources available, it is important \nthat the data should be linked, to obtain maximum \nvalue from the information (see Box 2.6). However, \nfor many countries, especially those with a number \nof systems at the local level, this is not always the \ncase. A major problem is coordination and sharing \nof information among different users. While there \nare usually issues of conﬁdentiality and other legal \nrestrictions involved, it should still be possible to \nﬁnd ways of summarizing the relevant information \nand making it available, without violating any legal \nprohibitions.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 78})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '56 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n Coordinated data management systems do exist \nin a handful of countries. One such example is the \nUnited States National Automotive Sampling System, \nthat combines information from four data systems \n– the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, the General \nEstimates System, the Crashworthiness Data System \nand the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Net -\nwork – to provide an overall picture for policy-mak -\ners and decision-makers at the national level ( 123). \n For the regular monitoring of road trafﬁc inju -\nries, a system that integrated information from both \npolice sources and health care sources would be \nideal. Although there have been a number of pilot \nprojects, such as the one combining police data on \nfatal crashes with the Hospital In-Patients Statistics \ndatabase in Scotland ( 124), few countries have estab -\nlished such linked systems on a routine basis.\nAnalysis of data\nAnalysing data, producing regular outputs and dis -\nseminating information on road trafﬁc injuries are \nall vital activities. For the purposes of data analysis, \nthere are some excellent software packages available. \nThese systems can build automatic validity checks \nand quality control into the data management \nprocess. Software packages also provide power -\nful analysis features for diagnosing problems that \nenable rational decisions to be made on priorities for \nintervention ( 125).\n High standards in data quality assurance and \nanalysis alone are not enough. Road trafﬁc injury \ninformation systems also need to allow all appropriate outside bodies access and to ensure that the informa -\ntion is effectively distributed. The design of databases \nshould therefore take account of the principal needs \nof all their users, providing quality data without over -\nburdening those collecting the data. Databases also \nrequire sufﬁcient resources to ensure their sustain -\nability. Countries should collaborate and help support \nregional and global systems so that the monitoring \nand evaluation of road safety can be improved and \nsustained.\nData issues and concerns\nIndicators\nIndicators are important tools not just for measur -\ning the magnitude of a problem but also for set -\nting targets and assessing performance. The most \nfrequently used absolute and relative indicators for \nmeasuring the magnitude of the road trafﬁc injury \nproblem are presented in Table 2.11.\n Two very common indicators are the number of \ndeaths per 100 000 population, and the number of \ndeaths per 10 000 vehicles. Both of these indicators \nhave limitations regarding their reliability and valid -\nity that place restrictions on how they can be used \nand interpreted. The number of deaths per 100 000 \npopulation is widely used with reasonable conﬁdence \nto monitor changes over time in “personal risk” levels \nand to make comparisons between countries. Errors \nin population statistics are assumed to have little \nimpact on the observed changes or comparisons. \n The use of vehicle registrations as an estimate \nof motorization is also problematical as there can BOX 2.6\nMultidisciplinary crash investigation\nAn example of in-depth multidisciplinary crash investigation is the Finnish national system, steered and supervised by \nthe Ministry of Transport and Communications and maintained by the Motor Insurers’ Centre and the Motor Trafﬁc \nInsurers Committee (VALT). \n The Centre started in-depth crash investigation in 1968 and its 21 law-based investigation teams investigate \nabout 500, mainly fatal crashes, at the scene of the crash, annually. Each team consists of police, a road safety \nengineer, a vehicle inspector, a medical doctor and sometimes a psychologist. Speciﬁc information is collected by \neach person and a combined report is produced on each case.  In each case, more than 500 variables are collected on \nstandardized forms. The emphasis is placed on data that will contribute to crash avoidance and injury prevention. In \naddition, the teams have legal rights to access information from ofﬁcial and private records and health care systems \nto obtain human, vehicle and road information.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 79})","('type', 'Document')"

Further -\nmore, changes in vehicle numbers do not generally \nprovide a good estimate of changes in exposure to, \nand travel on, the road network, especially when \nmaking comparisons between countries. A better \nindicator of trafﬁc safety risk is deaths per vehi -\ncle-kilometres, but this also fails to allow for non-\nmotorized travel.\n The measurement of exposure to the risk of road \ntrafﬁc injuries presents conceptual and methodo -\nlogical difﬁculties ( 127). An example of the use of \ntwo indicators – fatalities per 100 000 population \nand fatalities per 10 000 vehicles – is presented in Figure 2.9. The ﬁgure shows that since 1975 Malay -\nsia has experienced a continuous decline in deaths \nper 10 000 vehicles, whereas the rate of deaths per \n100 000 population has shown a slight increase. \nOver the same period, there has been a rapid \ngrowth in motorization and increased mobility \namong Malaysia’s population. The opposing trends \nin the two indicators reﬂect the fact that road traf -\nﬁc fatalities have increased more slowly in Malaysia \nthan the growth in the vehicle ﬂeet, but that they \nhave increased a little faster in recent years than \nthe growth in the population. More information is \nneeded to understand how changes in mobility and \nsafety standards have contributed to such trends.

"('page_content', '58 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nThe relationships between road trafﬁc injuries, \nmotorization and other major risk factors are dis -\ncussed in more detail in the next chapter.\n Though road trafﬁc injury statistics are used as \nmeasures of road safety, they are often inadequate \nand may even be misleading. This highlights the \nneed for existing measures to be reﬁned and new \nones to be explored.\nDeﬁnitions and standardization of data\nThere are a number of potential problems with the def -\ninitions of a road trafﬁc death or injury, arising from:\n— variations in the interpretation of the speci -\nﬁed time period between the injury event \nand death;\n — the actual interpretation of the deﬁnition in \ndifferent countries and by different people \nrecording the information;\n — differing levels of enforcement of deﬁnitions;\n — differing techniques for assessing the sever -\nity of injuries.\n The most commonly cited deﬁnition of a road traf -\nﬁc fatality is: “any person killed immediately or dying \nwithin 30 days as a result of an injury accident” ( 128). \nHowever, a recent study has revealed considerable \nvariations in working deﬁnitions. For example, in the \nEuropean Union, Greece, Portugal and Spain use 24 \nhours, France uses 6 days, Italy uses 7 days and the \nother countries use 30 days ( 129). To adjust for this variation, various correction fac -\ntors are applied to arrive at a 30-day \nequivalent. Such factors, though, \nthemselves introduce uncertainty \nas to what the real numbers would \nbe at 30 days.\n There are a number of other \ndeﬁnitional issues relating to the \nclassiﬁcation of an injury death as \none caused by a road trafﬁc crash, \nincluding ( 14, 129 ):\n — the method of assessment;\n — the location of a fatal crash \n(i.e. whether on a public or \nprivate road);\n — the mode of transport (some  \n classiﬁcations stipulate the \npresence of at least one moving vehicle);\n — the source reporting the data (i.e. whether \npolice or a self-report);\n — whether or not to include conﬁrmed suicides;\n — whether or not post-mortem examinations are \nroutinely conducted on road trafﬁc deaths.\n Deﬁnitional issues also arise with regard to sur -\nvivors of road trafﬁc crashes, including:\n — the actual deﬁnition and interpretation of a \nserious injury in different countries;\n — whether the police, who record most of the \ninformation, are sufﬁciently trained to ascer -\ntain and correctly assign injury severity.\n In Finland, for example, a serious road trafﬁc \ninjury is considered to involve hospital admission \nor three days off work; in Sweden, it involves hos -\npital admission as well as fractures, whether or not \nthe patient is admitted; while in France, it involves \na hospital stay of at least six days ( 129).\n Road trafﬁc injury and death cases can be missed \nby the data collection system because of differ -\nences in the deﬁnitions used in different countries \nand contexts. This issue highlights the need for the \nstandardization of deﬁnitions and their application \nacross different countries and settings.\nUnderreporting\nIt is clear from studies that underreporting of \nboth deaths and injuries is a major global problem 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999\nYearDeaths\n05101520253035\nDeaths per 100 000 populatio n\nDeaths per 10 000 vehicle sFIGURE 2.9\nRoad trafﬁc deaths in Malaysia\nSource: reference 126.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 81})","('type', 'Document')"

THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 59\naffecting not only low-income and middle-income \ncountries but also high-income ones ( 30, 129–131 ). \nIn the United Kingdom, studies comparing hospital \nand police records suggest that some 36% of road \ntrafﬁc injury casualties are not reported to the \npolice ( 129). In addition, around 20% of incidents \nreported to the police remain unrecorded. In some \nlow-income and middle-income countries, levels \nof underreporting can be as high as 50% ( 2, 132 ). \nUnderreporting can arise out of:\n — a failure on the part of the public to report;\n — the police not recording cases reported to them;\n — hospitals not reporting cases presenting to them;\n — an exemption for certain institutions, such \nas the military, from reporting directly to \nthe police.\n In some low-income and middle-income coun -\ntries, underreporting may stem from the basic fact \nthat some victims cannot afford to attend hospital \n(133, 134 ).\n The problem of underreporting highlights a \nnumber of structural, methodological and practical \nissues affecting the quality of data collected on road \ntrafﬁc injuries, including:\n — the coordination and reconciliation of data \nbetween sources;\n — the harmonization and application of agreed \ndeﬁnitions, especially the deﬁnition of a \nroad crash fatality;\n — the actual process of classiﬁcation and the \ncompletion of data forms.\n These problems make it difﬁcult to obtain reliable \nestimates on road trafﬁc fatalities and injuries world -\nwide and also for certain countries. Harmonization \nof data at the national and international levels can \nbe facilitated by adopting international deﬁnitions. \nThe International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD-10) \n(135) and the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) can be \nused for non-fatal road crash injuries ( 136). Agree -\nments to adhere to regional systems such as IRTAD \nand the Asia-Paciﬁc Road Accident Database will \nencourage the uniformity of deﬁnitions.\nOther issues\nStudies have uncovered a number of other problems \nrelated to road trafﬁc injury data and evidence. These include:\n — missing information within individual \nrecords;\n — the unavailability of certain speciﬁc data (e.g. \nthe crash location, type of injury, identiﬁcation \nof the vehicle in which the casualty occurred);\n — the scientiﬁc soundness of the methods used;\n — inadequate quality control;\n — lack of data collection on cycling and walk -\ning in transport information systems;\n — lack of data on exposure;\n — the accuracy and completeness of police \nassessment of cause of crash;\n — lack of professionals trained in road safety;\n — lack of rigorous evaluation of interventions, \nparticularly in low-income and middle-\nincome countries.\nLimitations of the data sources \nused in this chapter\nAlthough the present assessment of the extent of \nthe burden of road trafﬁc injury is based on the \nbest available global data, it is recognized that the \nunderlying data sources do suffer from a number \nof limitations. The main ones are outlined below:\n• The WHO mortality database lacks complete \ncoverage of vital registration data from all \nWHO regions. Several countries do not report \nroad trafﬁc incidence data at all. Projected data \nfor some regions are therefore based on rela -\ntively small samples of data and can be in error \nbecause of missing country information. This \nhas been dealt with by computing estimates \nusing a methodology described in the Statisti -\ncal Annex. The limitation highlights the need \nfor more countries to submit road trafﬁc injury \ndata to the WHO mortality database.\n• The GBD estimates are based largely on 1990 \ndata and although they have been adjusted \nrepeatedly since then, regional and national \nchanges may have made some of the regional \nprojections unreliable. In addition, there is a \nclear absence of routinely available data, both \nglobal and national, on the long-term health \nand social impacts of road trafﬁc crashes. This \nshortcoming has led to a reliance on studies ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 82})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '60 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nundertaken primarily in high-income coun -\ntries and a corresponding risk of bias if the \nprojected assumptions for low-income and \nmiddle-income countries are not accurate.\n• The World Bank and TRL Ltd both rely on road \ntrafﬁc mortality data that originated from police \nsources, and which, in common with WHO \ndata, suffer from problems related to incomplete \ncoverage. There is also the problem of differ -\ning deﬁnitions of death, that vary from “dead \non the spot” to death some time after the crash \noccurred. The standard deﬁnition is “death \nwithin 30 days of the crash”, though in practice, \nmany countries do not follow it. Both the World \nBank and TRL Ltd have made attempts to cor -\nrect for the underestimates arising from these \nproblems. To correct for different deﬁnitions \nof death, they used the European Conference \nof Ministers of Transport adjustment for high-\nincome country values (a maximum of 30%, \ndepending on the deﬁnition used), and they \nadded 15% to all ﬁgures from low-income and \nmiddle-income countries ( 1, 2). In addition, \nboth groups made a further correction, adding \n2% to the data for high-income countries and \n25% for low-income and middle-income coun -\ntries, to allow for underreporting of road trafﬁc \nfatalities generally. The TRL study regarded this \nas a minimum adjustment for underreporting, \nand set a maximum at +5% for high-income \ncountry ﬁgures and +50% for low-income and \nmiddle-income countries ( 2). The World Bank \nstudy base-year data was comparable to the TRL \nLtd minimum underreporting data ( 1).\n Information on speciﬁc topics such as road safety \nand the elderly, inequality, location (including rural–\nurban differences), road safety and public transport, \nand occupational road trafﬁc injuries was extremely \nlimited. Nevertheless, a concerted effort was made \nto secure all available studies from online databases, \npublished sources and the “grey literature” – such as \ninformation published in local, non-indexed jour -\nnals, government reports and unpublished theses \n– on these as well as other themes. This yielded a \nnumber of studies that have been used to illustrate \nthese topics throughout the chapter.Conclusion\nThe problem of road trafﬁc crashes and injuries is \ngrowing both in absolute numbers and in relative \nterms. It is a serious public health and development \nissue, taxing health care systems and undermining \ntheir ability to devote limited resources to other \nareas of need. The magnitude of road trafﬁc inju -\nries globally can be summarized as follows:\n• More than one million people are killed \nworldwide every year as a result of road trafﬁc \ncrashes.\n• Road trafﬁc injuries are the 11th leading cause \nof death and the 9th leading cause of disabil -\nity-adjusted life years lost worldwide.\n• The poor and vulnerable road users – pedes -\ntrians, cyclists and motorcyclists – bear the \ngreatest burden.\n• Some 90% of road trafﬁc deaths occur in \nthe developing world, which comprises two \nthirds of the global population.\n• As motorization increases, many low-income \nand middle-income countries may face a grow -\ning toll of road trafﬁc injuries, with potentially \ndevastating consequences in human, social and \neconomic terms.\n• Males are more likely to be involved in road \ntrafﬁc crashes than females.\n• Economically active adults, aged 15–44 years, \naccount for more than half of all the road trafﬁc \ndeaths.\n• Without new or improved interventions, road \ntrafﬁc injuries will be the third leading cause \nof death by the year 2020.\n The health, social and economic impacts of road \ntrafﬁc crashes are substantial.\n• Between 20 million and 50 million people \nsustain an injury as a result of motor vehicle \ncrashes each year.\n• Nearly a quarter of all non-fatally injured victims \nrequiring hospitalization sustain a traumatic \nbrain injury as a result of motor vehicle crashes.\n• Between 30% and 86% of trauma admissions \nin some low-income and middle-income \ncountries are the result of road trafﬁc crashes.\n• Millions of people are temporarily or perma -\nnently disabled as a result of road trafﬁc crashes.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 83})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 2.  THE GLOBAL IMPACT  • 61\n• Many people suffer signiﬁcant psychological \nconsequences for years following a motor \nvehicle crash.\n• Road trafﬁc crashes cost governments, on \naverage, between 1% and 2% of their gross \nnational product.\n• The social costs – more difﬁcult to quantify \n– exact a heavy toll on victims, their families, \nfriends and communities.\n• The death of a breadwinner often pushes a \nfamily into poverty.\n Accurate data are essential for prioritizing pub -\nlic health issues, monitoring trends and assessing \nintervention programmes. Many countries have \ninadequate information systems on road trafﬁc \ninjury, making it difﬁcult to realize the full nature \nof the problem and thus gain the attention that \nis required from policy-makers and decision-\nmakers. There are a number of areas where road \ntrafﬁc injury data are often problematic, and these \ninclude:\n— sources of data (e.g. whether data are from \npolice or health sources);\n— the types of data collected;\n— inappropriate use of indicators;\n— non-standardization of data;\n— deﬁnitional issues related to trafﬁc deaths \nand injuries;\n— underreporting;\n— poor harmonization and linkages between \ndifferent sources of data.\n Governments can help foster stronger collabora -\ntion between different groups that collect and keep \ndata and evidence on road trafﬁc injuries. Further -\nmore, it is essential that data collection and global \nstandards be better coordinated – an area in which \nthe United Nations regional commissions could \ntake a leading role. With such improved collabora -\ntion and improved management of data, signiﬁcant \nreductions can be achieved in the magnitude of \nroad trafﬁc casualties.References\n1.  Kopits E, Cropper M.

"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 3.  RISK FACTORS  • 71\nIntroduction\nIn road trafﬁc, risk is a function of four elements. \nThe ﬁrst is the exposure – the amount of move -\nment or travel within the system by different users \nor a given population density. The second is the \nunderlying probability of a crash, given a particu -\nlar exposure. The third is the probability of injury, \ngiven a crash. The fourth element is the outcome of \ninjury. This situation is summarized in Figure 3.1. Risk arises largely as a result of various factors, \nthat include ( 1):\n— human error within the trafﬁc system;\n— the size and nature of the kinetic energy of \nthe impact to which people in the system are \nexposed as a result of errors;\n— the tolerance of the individual to this \nimpact;\n— the quality and availability of emergency \nservices and acute trauma care.\n The human operator often adapts to changing \nconditions in ways that do not always serve safety. \nA single error can have life or death consequences. \nBehind road-user errors, there are natural \nlimitations. These include vision in night trafﬁc, the \ndetection of targets in the periphery of the eye, the \nestimation of speed and distance, the processing of \ninformation by the brain, and other physiological \nfactors associated with age and sex that have a \nbearing on crash risk. Also inﬂuencing human \nerror are external factors such as the design of the \nroad, the design of the vehicle, trafﬁc rules and \nthe enforcement of trafﬁc rules ( 2). Sophisticated \nand quality-assured systems that combine human \nbeings and machines, therefore, need to have an \nin-built tolerance of human error ( 1).\n The tolerance of the human body to the physi -\ncal forces released in crashes is limited. Injury is \nbroadly related to the kinetic energy applied to \nthe human frame. The energy involved in a col -\nlision varies as the square of the velocity, so that \nsmall increases in speed result in major increases \nin the risk of injury. The relationship between \nimpact forces in crashes and the injuries that are \nsustained is known for a number of parts of the \nbody and type of injury – for different categories of \nroad user, as well as for different age groups. Bio-\nmechanical thresholds associated with age, sex and \nspeed are reliable predictors of crash injury. For \nexample, impact forces that produce a moderate \ninjury in a robust 25-year-old male will result in a \nlife-threatening injury if applied to a 65-year-old \ninﬁrm female ( 3).\n The main road injury problems are being sus -\ntained worldwide by people who make similar \nmistakes, share the same human tolerance to Factors influencing exposur e to risk\nEconomic factors, including social deprivation\nDemographic factors\nLand use planning practices which influence the length\nof a trip or travel mode choice\nMixture of high-speed motorized traffic with vulnerable\nroad users\nInsufficient attention to integration of r oad function\nwith decisions about speed limits, r oad layout and\ndesign\nRisk factors influencing crash involvement\nInappr opriate or excessive speed\nPresence of alcohol, medicinal or r ecreational drugs\nFatigue\nBeing a young maleBeing a vulnerable r oad user in urban and residentia\nl\nareas\nTravelling in darkness\nVehicle factors – such as braking, handling and \nmaintenance\nDefects in road design, layout and maintenance which\ncan also lead to unsafe r oad user behaviour\nInadequate visibility due to envir onmental factors \n(making it har d to detect vehicles and other r oad \nusers)\nPoor r oad user eyesight\nRisk factors influencing crash severity\nHuman tolerance factors\nInappr opriate or excessive speed\nSeat-belts and child r estraints not used\nCrash helmets not wo rn by users of two-wheeled \nvehicles\nRoadside objects not crash pr otective\nInsufficient vehicle crash pr otection for occupants and\nfor those hit by vehicles\nPresence of alcohol and other drugs\nRisk factors influencing severity of post-crash injuries\nDelay in detecting crash\nPresence of fi re resulting fr om collisio n\nLeakage of hazar dous material s\nPresence of alcohol and other drugs\nDifficulty rescuing and extracting people from vehicles\nDifficulty evacuating people from buses and coaches\ninvolved in crash\nLack of appr opriate pr e-hospital car e\nLack of appr opriate car e in the hospital emergency \nroomsFIGURE 3.1\nThe main risk factors for road trafﬁc injuries')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 94})","('type', 'Document')"

While the problems are different \nboth qualitatively and quantitatively, the main risk \nfactors appear to be the same worldwide ( 4,5).\n Traditionally, analysis of risk has examined the \nroad user, vehicle and road environment separately. \nIn this report, a systems framework, where interac -\ntions between different components are taken into \naccount, is used. Such a systems-oriented approach \nhas been necessary for signiﬁcant progress in tack -\nling road trauma to be made ( 6).\nFactors inﬂuencing exposure to risk\nRisk in road trafﬁc arises out of a need to travel – to \nhave access to work, for instance, or for education \nor leisure pursuits. A range of factors determines \nwho uses different parts of the transport system, \nhow it is used and why, and at what times ( 7).\n While in practical terms it may not be possible \ncompletely to eliminate all risk, it is possible to \nreduce the exposure to risk of severe injury and to \nminimize its intensity and consequences ( 1).\nRapid motorization\nMotor vehicles\nOne of the main factors con -\ntributing to the increase in \nglobal road crash injury is the \ngrowing number of motor \nvehicles.\n Since 1949, when Smeed \n(8) ﬁrst demonstrated a rela -\ntionship between fatality rates \nand motorization, several \nstudies have shown a correla -\ntion between motor vehicle \ngrowth and the number of \nroad crashes and injuries. \nWhile the motor vehicle and \nsubsequent growth in the \nnumber of motor vehicles \nand road infrastructure has \nbrought societal beneﬁt, it \nhas also led to societal cost \nto which road trafﬁc injury \ncontributes signiﬁcantly. This explains why a number of studies are drawing \nattention to the need for careful consideration and \nplanning of transport and mobility in view of the \nincreasing motorization in different parts of the \nworld ( 9–11).\n Periods of economic prosperity tend to be \nassociated with increasing mobility and demand \nfor transport services. On the other hand, peri -\nods of economic decline lead to low generation \nof movement ( 12). In times of economic growth, \ntrafﬁc volumes increase, along with the number \nof crashes and injuries, and there are generally \nreductions in walking and cycling. Reductions in \nalcohol-related crashes have also been observed to \ncoincide with periods of economic recession ( 13).\n Motorization rate rises with income ( 14). In \nwealthier countries, there has been dramatic \ngrowth in the numbers of cars, but in many poorer \ncountries the increases have been principally in \nmotorcycles and minibuses. Some 80% of all cars \nare owned by 15% of the world’s population, situ -\nated in North America, western Europe and Japan. \nFigure 3.2 and Table A.6 in the Statistical Annex \nboth show that motorization is strongly correlated \nwith income.\nFIGURE 3.2\nMotorization rate versus incomeaVehicles per 10 000 persons8 000\n4 0006 000\n2 000\n0\n0 5 000 10 000 15 000 20 000 25 000\nPer capita gross domestic product, 1985 international dollarsHD1 observations\nHD2 observations\na HDI is the United Nations Human Development Index.

"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 3.  RISK FACTORS  • 73\n In China, where the economy is experiencing \nrapid growth, the number of vehicles has more \nthan quadrupled since 1990, to over 55 million. \nIn Thailand, between 1987 and 1997, there was \nan almost four-fold increase in the number of \nregistered motor vehicles, from 4.9 million to 17.7 \nmillion ( 15). In India, the number of four-wheeled \nmotor vehicles increased by 23% to 4.5 million \nbetween 1990 and 1993. All of these ﬁgures are \nfar below the rates of car ownership per capita in \nhigh-income countries ( 16). It is predicted that the \nmotor vehicle numbers for countries of the Organ -\nisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop -\nment (OECD) could increase up to 62% by the year \n2015, to a total of 705 million ( 14).\n Motor vehicle growth in low-income countries \nis taking place against a background of associated \nproblems. Only a small number of people in these \ncountries can afford cars, while the costs of roads, \nparking spaces, air pollution and road trafﬁc inju -\nries are borne by the whole society ( 9). Despite the \nrapid growth in motorized trafﬁc, most families \nin low-income and middle-income countries are \nunlikely to own a car within the next 25 years ( 5). \nIn terms of exposure to risk, the main modes of \ntravel in these countries in the foreseeable future \nare likely to remain walking, cycling and public \ntransport. This emphasizes the importance of plan -\nning for the needs of these road users, who, as was \nseen in Chapter 2, bear a high proportion of the \nburden of road trafﬁc injuries.\n The case of reuniﬁcation in Germany provides \na good illustration of how economic factors can \ninﬂuence crash injury. Here, overnight, many peo -\nple suddenly experienced a surge in afﬂuence and \naccess to previously unavailable cars. In the two \nyears following reuniﬁcation, the number of cars \nthat were bought and the total distance travelled \nby cars increased by over 40%. At the same time, \nbetween 1989 and 1991, there was a four-fold \nincrease in death rates for car occupants, with an \neleven-fold increase for those aged 18–20 years. \nThe overall death rate in road crashes in this period \nnearly doubled, from 4 per 100 000 population in \n1989 to 8 per 100 000 in 1991 ( 17). Other countries \nwhere motor vehicle growth has been shown to be associated with an increase in road trafﬁc injuries \nare the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland ( 11, \n18). In Poland, for every additional 1000 cars pur -\nchased between 1989 and 1991, an additional 1.8 \ntrafﬁc fatalities and 27 people injured in crashes \nwere recorded ( 11).\n Trafﬁc volume is a particularly important risk \nfactor for injuries among child pedestrians. Rob -\nerts et al. have shown that when trafﬁc volumes fall \nthere is a reduction in child pedestrian death rates \n(19, 20 ).\n Buses and trucks are a major mode of travel in \nlow-income and middle-income countries. High \nvolumes of passengers being transported have an \nimpact on the safety, not only of the passengers \nthemselves, but also on vulnerable road users. In \nNew Delhi, buses and trucks are involved in almost \ntwo thirds of crashes involving vulnerable road \nusers, and these people make up over 75% of all \nroad trafﬁc deaths ( 5).\nMotorized two-wheeled vehicles\nAlthough the greatest growth rate in the number of \nmotor vehicles is expected in Asian countries, most \nof the increase in vehicle ﬂeets is likely to be in \nmotorized two-wheeled vehicles and three-wheel -\ners ( 5). In many such places, it is estimated that \nmotorized two-wheelers will comprise between \n40% and 70% of the total vehicle ﬂeet.\n In south-east Asia, there are several countries \nwith a large proportion of two-wheeled and three-\nwheeled vehicles whose growth in numbers has \nbeen associated with a large rise in road trafﬁc \ninjuries. Examples are Cambodia (where 75% of \nall vehicles are motorized two-wheelers or motor -\nized three-wheelers), the Lao People’s Democratic \nRepublic (79%), Malaysia (51%) and Viet Nam \n(95%). In Viet Nam, the number of motorcycles \ngrew by 29% during 2001; at the same time road \ndeaths rose by 37% ( 21). An increase in use of \nmotorized two-wheelers in China, Province of \nTaiwan, where such vehicles comprise 65% of all \nregistered motor vehicles, was also associated with \nincreasing deaths and injuries ( 22).\n In the United Kingdom, after a long-term \ndownward trend in both motorized two-wheeler ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 96})","('type', 'Document')"

The \nnational level of deaths and serious injuries among \nusers of motorized two-wheelers in 2001 was 21% \nabove the average for 1994–1998 ( 23).\n Like other motor vehicles, motorized two-\nwheelers also cause injuries to other road users. \nIn low-income countries, where the majority of \npedestrian impacts are with buses and cars, one \nhospital-based study in New Delhi found that 16% \nof injured pedestrians had been struck by motor -\nized two-wheelers ( 24).\nNon-motorized trafﬁc\nNon-motorized vehicles predominate in both rural \nand urban areas in some low-income and middle-\nincome countries. In these countries, the proportion \nof road trafﬁc injuries from non-motorized forms \nof travel varies according to the way motorized and \nnon-motorized modes of travel are split ( 11). In Asia, \nhowever, motorcycles are dominant, which partly \nexplains the high proportion of motorcycle fatalities \nand injuries. Generally speaking in developing coun -\ntries, pedestrian and cyclist trafﬁc has grown without \naccompanying improvements in facilities for these \nroad users. The high number of pedestrian and cyclist \ncasualties in these countries reﬂects not only their \ninherent vulnerability but also insufﬁcient attention \nto their needs in policy-making ( 11, 25, 26 ).\nDemographic factors\nDifferent groups of people have different expo -\nsures to risk. As populations change over time, \nso the overall exposure of that population will \nchange. Fluctuations in the relative sizes of differ -\nent population groups will have a strong effect on \nthe road trafﬁc toll. For instance, in industrialized \ncountries, young drivers and riders – at increased \nrisk of involvement in road crashes – are currently \noverrepresented in casualty ﬁgures. Demographic \nchanges, though, in these countries over the next \n20–30 years will result in road users over 65 years \nof age becoming the largest group of road users. \nTheir physical vulnerability, though, places them at high risk of fatal and serious injuries ( 27). In \nlow-income countries, the expected demographic \nevolution suggests that younger road users will \ncontinue to be the predominant group involved in \nroad crashes.\n In some high-income countries, more than \n20% of the population will be 65 years or above \nby 2030 ( 28). Despite the rising number of older \npeople holding driving licences in such countries, \ntheir declining driving ability as well as possible \nﬁnancial constraints will mean that many of them \nwill have to give up driving. In many low-income \ncountries, older people may never have driven \nin the ﬁrst place. Worldwide, a large proportion \nof older people will still be dependent on public \ntransport or will walk. This illustrates the impor -\ntance of providing safer and shorter pedestrian \nroutes and safe and convenient public transport.\nTransport, land use and road network \nplanning\nPlanning decisions regarding transport, land use \nand road networks have signiﬁcant effects on pub -\nlic health – as they affect the amount of air pol -\nlution by vehicles, the degree of physical exercise \nundertaken by individuals, and the volume of road \ntrafﬁc crashes and injuries.\n The development of a network of roads – or \nindeed of other forms of transport, such as rail -\nways – has a profound effect on communities and \nindividuals. It inﬂuences such things as economic \nactivity, property prices, air and noise pollution, \nsocial deprivation and crime – in addition to \nhealth. Long commuting times degrade the qual -\nity of life and therefore health. Sedentary travel \ndirectly and adversely affects health ( 29).\n In the absence of proper land-use planning, resi -\ndential, commercial and industrial activity will evolve \nin a haphazard pattern, and road trafﬁc will evolve \nsimilarly to meet the needs of these various activities. \nThis is likely to produce heavy ﬂows of trafﬁc through \nresidential areas, vehicles capable of high speed mix -\ning with pedestrians, and heavy, long-distance com -\nmercial trafﬁc using routes not designed for such \nvehicles. The consequent exposure to trafﬁc injury \ncan be high for car occupants, and even more so for ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 97})","('type', 'Document')"

RISK FACTORS  • 75\nvulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists \nand motorized two-wheeler users ( 30).\n The mixed nature of road trafﬁc in many low-\nincome and middle-income countries – with pedes -\ntrians, bicycles, handcarts, mopeds, motorcycles, \nvans, cars, trucks and buses in different propor -\ntions – means that many of the technical aspects of \nplanning, highway design, trafﬁc engineering and \ntrafﬁc management need to be worked out locally, \nrather than being imported. For example, in many \nAsian cities, with some notable exceptions, the \nroad network is used by at least seven categories of \nmotorized and non-motorized vehicles, of varying \nwidths and speeds, all sharing the road space. There \nis generally no effective channelling or segregation \nof the different categories, or speed control ( 31).\n Where planning of land use does take place, it is \noften done with a view to creating efﬁcient ﬂows of \ntrafﬁc, resulting in major arterial, high-speed routes \nthat cut off different urban sections, to the disadvan -\ntage of local residents. Environmental criteria – such \nas reductions in noise, pollution and visual intrusion \n– are also often employed in planning. Safety consid -\nerations are brought in much less often. When safety \ncriteria are applied to land use planning, though, \nthere is ample evidence of signiﬁcant reductions in \nexposure to trafﬁc injury ( 29).\nIncreased need for travel\nAll growing urban areas experience a movement \nof residents from the inner districts to the suburbs. \nSocioeconomic changes in many places are leading \nto a profusion of out-of-town supermarkets and \nshopping malls, with a consequent loss of local \nshops. Both of these phenomena generate increased \ntrafﬁc, less opportunity for travel by public trans -\nport, and increased exposure to risk.\n These factors need to be better recognized and \nevaluated in planning processes. This applies not \nonly to developed countries but also to developing \ncountries, some of which contain rapidly-growing \nmegacities, with their signiﬁcant but undocumented \nchanges in patterns of wealth and living space.\nChoice of less safe forms of travel\nOf the four main modes of travel, road travel scores by far the highest risk in most countries – using \nalmost any measure of exposure – compared with \nrail, air and marine travel ( 32, 33 ).\n Within the mode of road travel, major variations \nin risk exist between pedestrians, cyclists, riders of \nmotorized two-wheelers, car occupants, and bus \nand truck passengers. The risks for these road users \nalso vary greatly according to the trafﬁc mix and \nhence vary greatly from country to country. In gen -\neral, in high-income countries, riders of motorized \ntwo-wheelers have the highest levels of risk.\n In European Union countries, the risk of death \nfor motorized two-wheeler users is 20 times that \nof car occupants (see Table 3.1). Travelling by car is \nsome 7–9 times safer than cycling or walking, but \ncar occupants are still 10 times less safe than bus \noccupants. All these relative risks are calculated on \nthe basis of distance travelled. Even when the risks \nof walking or cycling before or after a train or bus \ntrip are taken into account, travel by public trans -\nport is still safer than car travel, when the collective \nsafety of all users is considered ( 32).\n \nThe choice of mode of travel is greatly inﬂuenced \nby the climate. Extremes of temperature severely \nlimit cycling and walking.TABLE 3.1\nDeaths per 100 million passenger-kilometres versus \npassenger-travel hours in European Union countries \nfor the period 2001–2002\nDeaths per 100 \nmillion passenger- \nkilometresaDeaths per 100 \nmillion passenger- \ntravel hoursb\nRoads (total)  0.95 28\n   Powered two-wheelers 13.8 440\n   Foot 6.4 75\n   Cycle 5.4 25\n   Car 0.7 25\n   Bus and coach 0.07 2\nFerry 0.25 16\nAir (civil aviation) 0.035 8\nRail 0.035 2\na Passenger-kilometres is the total distance covered by all the \nindividuals travelling on that mode.\nb  Passenger-travel hours is the total time spent by all the \nindividuals travelling on that mode.\nSource: reproduced from reference 32, with minor editorial \namendments, with the permission of the publisher.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 98})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '76 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n As Table 3.2 shows, the trafﬁc crash cost of inju -\nries among motorized two-wheeler users is also \nhigher than for any other mode ( 33).\n \nThe level and mix of motorized two-wheeler use \nhave long been volatile features of road use, both \nfor urban commuting and for rural recreation ( 34). \nIn this context, if the number of road injuries is to \nbe minimized, care should be taken to avoid the \nadoption of policies which could encourage the \ngrowth of motorized two-wheeler trafﬁc by giv -\ning advantages to motorized two-wheeler users. \n A recent report by the organization Transport \nfor London stated that one reason for providing \nmotorized two-wheelers with exemption from the \ncity’s congestion charge scheme was their smaller \ncontribution to congestion in central London. \nTransport for London suggested that there could be \na small increase in motorized two-wheeler activ -\nity as a consequence of the new scheme, though \nit stated that distinguishing such a change from \nbackground trends could be difﬁcult ( 35). When \ncompared against trends over recent years for all \nother vehicle types, though, the relative share \nof trips undertaken by motorized two-wheelers \nwas already increasing ( 35), and motorized two-\nwheeler users are a leading casualty group in the \nUnited Kingdom. By the end of 2002, deaths and \nserious injuries among motorized two-wheeler \nusers in London were 31% above the 1994–1998 \naverage ( 36). Thus if present trends continue, it \nseems unlikely that the target of a 40% reduction \nin motorcycle deaths by 2010 will be achieved.Risk factors inﬂuencing crash \ninvolvement\nSpeed\nThe speed of motor vehicles is at the core of the \nroad injury problem. Speed inﬂuences both crash \nrisk and crash consequence.\n “Excess speed” is deﬁned as a vehicle exceed -\ning the relevant speed limit; “inappropriate speed” \nrefers to a vehicle travelling at a speed unsuit -\nable for the prevailing road and trafﬁc conditions. \nWhile speed limits only declare higher speeds to be \nillegal it remains for each driver and rider to decide \nthe appropriate speed within the limit.\n The speed drivers choose to travel at is inﬂu -\nenced by many factors (see Table 3.3). Modern \ncars have high rates of acceleration and can eas -\nily reach very high speeds in short distances. The \nphysical layout of the road and its surroundings \ncan both encourage and discourage speed. Crash \nrisk increases as speed increases, especially at road \njunctions and while overtaking – as road users \nunderestimate the speed, and overestimate the dis -\ntance, of an approaching vehicle.\nCrash risk\nThere is a large amount of evidence of a signiﬁcant \nrelationship between mean speed and crash risk:TABLE 3.2 \nTrafﬁc crash cost per passenger-kilometres\nMode of transport Cost per \npassenger- km\n(in US$)\nCommercial aviation     0.01\nRail     0.06\nBus     0.23\nCar     0.28\nGeneral aviation     0.39\nMotorcycle    1.52\nSource: reproduced from reference 33, with the permission of the \npublisher.\nTABLE 3.3\nExamples of factors affecting drivers’ choice of \nspeed\nRoad and vehicle \nrelatedTrafﬁc and \nenvironment relatedDriver related\nRoad\n  Width\n  Gradient\n  Alignment\n  Surroundings\n  Layout\n  Markings\n  Surface quality\nVehicle\n  Type\n  Power/weight ratio\n  Maximum speed\n  ComfortTrafﬁc\n  Density\n  Composition\n  Prevailing speed\nEnvironment\n  Weather\n  Surface condition\n  Natural light\n  Road lighting\n  Signs\n  Speed limit\n  EnforcementAge\nSex\nReaction time\nAttitudes\nThrill-seeking\nRisk acceptance\nHazard perception\nAlcohol level\nOwnership of vehicle\nCircumstances of       \n  journey\nOccupancy of vehicle\nSource: reproduced from reference 37, with the permission of the \npublisher.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 99})","('type', 'Document')"

The probability of \na fatal crash is related to the fourth power of \nthe speed ( 38, 39 ).\n• Empirical evidence from speed studies in var -\nious countries has shown that an increase of \n1 km/h in mean trafﬁc speed typically results \nin a 3% increase in the incidence of injury \ncrashes (or an increase of 4–5% for fatal \ncrashes), and a decrease of 1 km/h in mean \ntrafﬁc speed will result in a 3% decrease in \nthe incidence of injury crashes (or a decrease \nof 4–5% for fatal crashes) ( 40).\n• Taylor et al. ( 41, 42 ), in their study on dif -\nferent types of roads in the United Kingdom, \nconcluded that for every 1 mile/h (1.6 km/h) \nreduction in average trafﬁc speed, the high -\nest reduction achievable in the volume of \ncrashes was 6% (in the case of urban roads \nwith low average speeds). These are typically \nbusy main roads in towns with high levels of \npedestrian activity, wide variations in speeds \nand high frequencies of crashes.\n• A meta-analysis of 36 studies on speed limit \nchanges showed, at levels above 50 km/h, a \ndecrease of 2% in the number of crashes for \nevery 1 km/h reduction in the average speed \n(43).\n• A variation in speeds between different vehi -\ncles travelling at different speeds within the \ntrafﬁc stream is also associated with crash \noccurrence ( 44).\n• A study of crashes within rural 60 km/h zones \ninvolving injuries to car occupants found that \nthe relative risk of crash involvement doubles, \nor more, for each increase of 5 km/h of trav -\nelling speed above 60 km/h ( 45) (see Table \n3.4). Travelling at 5 km/h above a road speed \nlimit of 60 km/h results in an increase in the \nrelative risk of being involved in a casualty \ncrash that is comparable with having a blood \nalcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05 gram per \ndecilitre (g/dl) ( 45).Severity of crash injuries\nSpeed has an exponentially detrimental effect on \nsafety. As speeds increase, so do the number and \nseverity of injuries. Studies show that the higher \nthe impact speed, the greater the likelihood of seri -\nous and fatal injury:\n• For car occupants, the severity of crash injury \ndepends on the change of speed during the \nimpact, usually denoted as Δv. As Δv increases \nfrom about 20 km/h to 100 km/h, the prob -\nability of fatal injuries increases from close to \nzero to almost 100% ( 46).\n• The probability of serious injury for belted \nfront-seat occupants is three times as great at \n30 miles/h (48 km/h) and four times as great \nat 40 miles/h (64 km/h), compared with the \nrisk at 20 miles/h (32 km/h) ( 47).\n• For car occupants in a crash with an impact \nspeed of 50 miles/h (80 km/h), the likelihood \nof death is 20 times what it would have been at \nan impact speed of 20 miles/h (32 km/h) ( 48).\n• Pedestrians have a 90% chance of surviving car \ncrashes at 30 km/h or below, but less than a \n50% chance of surviving impacts at 45 km/h \nor above ( 49, 50 ) (see Figure 3.3).\n• The probability of a pedestrian being killed rises \nby a factor of eight as the impact speed of the car \nincreases from 30 km/h to 50 km/h ( 51).\n• Older pedestrians are even more physically vul -\nnerable as speeds increase ( 52) (see Figure 3.4).\n• Excess and inappropriate speed contributes to \naround 30% of fatal crashes in high-income \ncountries ( 53).TABLE 3.4 \nRelative risks of involvement in a casualty crash for \nspeed and alcohol\nSpeed\n(km/h)Speed\n(relative riska)Blood alcohol \nconcentration\n(g/dl)Blood alcohol \nconcentration\n(relative riskb) \n60 1.0 0.00 1.0\n65 2.0 0.05 1.8\n70 4.2 0.08 3.2\n75 10.6 0.12 7.1\n80 31.8 0.21 30.4\na  Relative to a sober driver travelling at the speed limit of 60 km/h.\nb  Relative to driving with a zero blood alcohol concentration.\nSource: reproduced from reference 45 with the permission of the \npublisher.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 100})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '78 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n \n In China, in 1999, speed was the main reported \ncause of road trafﬁc crashes ( 54). Errors – such as \nloss of control of vehicle, speeding, misjudgement \nand improper overtaking – contributed to 44% of \nall police-reported crashes in Kenya ( 55). Speed was \nidentiﬁed as the main contributory factor in 50% of \nroad crashes in Ghana between 1998 and 2000 ( 56).\n Speed has also been identiﬁed as an important \nfactor in crashes involving commercial road trans -\nport and public passenger vehicles ( 55, 57 ). In South \nAfrica, for instance, 50% of such crashes are related \nto speed ( 57). While in many high-income coun -\ntries, there is increasing use of in-built mechanisms in trucks and buses to restrict speeds above a certain \nlimit, such devices are frequently resisted in low-\nincome and middle-income countries for com -\nmercial reasons, or else, if installed, are disabled \nby the operators. Commercial operations are often \nbased on timetables that put pressure on drivers to \nspeed. In many low-income and middle-income \ncountries, the pay of bus drivers is related to ticket \nreceipts, which encourages high speeds ( 58).\n Everywhere, speed limits are widely ﬂouted ( 37). \nAt high speeds, environmental damage from exhaust \nemissions and trafﬁc noise are greater at higher than \nat moderate speeds.\n Figure 3.5 summarizes the main effects of speed \non the risk of crashes and crash injury.\nPedestrians and cyclists\nA disproportionately large number of pedestrian FIGURE 3.3\nPedestrian fatality risk as a function of the impact \nspeed of a car\n0.61\n0.8\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n20 0 40 60 8 0 100\nImpact speed (km/h)Probability of death\nSource: reproduced from reference 49, with the permission of the \npublisher. \nFIGURE 3.4\nFatal injury rates by vehicle speed and pedestrian \nage in Florida, 1993–1996 (pedestrians in single-  \nvehicle crashes)\nPercentage killed\n010203040506070\nEstimated vehicle travel speed* * 1 mile = 1.6 km1.6–32 km/h 33.6–40 km/h 41.6–48 km/h 49.6–56 km/h 57.6–72 km/h >73.6 km/h1–20 mph 2 1–25 mph 2 6–30 mph 3 1–35 mph 3 6–45 mp h >46 mp h65 or more years\n45–64 years\n25–44 years\n15–24 years\n14 or less years\nSource: reproduced from reference 52, with minor editorial \namendments, with the permission of the publisher. In highly-motorized countries, excessive and inappropriate \nspeed is a major cause of around one in three of all fatal \nand serious crashes (53). Speed affects the risk of a crash  \noccurring: the greater the speed, the less time there is to \nprevent a collision. At the same time, the greater the \nspeed, the more severe the consequences, once a crash  \nhas occurred. Various studies have indicated that:\n� An average increase in speed of 1 km/h is associated  \nwith a 3% higher risk of a crash involving an injury (40, \n41).\n� In severe crashes, the increased risk is even greater. In \nsuch cases, an average increase in speed of 1 km/h leads  \nto a 5% higher risk of serious or fatal injury (40, 41) .\n� Travelling at 5 km/h above a road speed limit of 65 \nkm/h results in an increase in the relative risk of \nbeing involved in a casualty crash that is comparable \nwith having a BAC of 0.05 g/dl (45).\n� For car occupants in a crash with an impact speed of \n50 miles/h (80 km/h), the likelihood of death is 20 times  \nwhat it would have been at an impact speed of 20 miles/h \n(32 km/h) (48).\n� Pedestrians have a 90% chance of surviving car \ncrashes at 30km/h or below, but less than a 50% \nchance of surviving impacts at 45 km/h or above (50).\n� The probability of a pedestrian being killed rises by a \nfactor of 8 as the impact speed of the car increases from \n30 km/h to 50 km/h (51).FIGURE 3.5\nSummary of the effects of speed on crashes and crash \ninjury')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 101})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 3.  RISK FACTORS  • 79\ncrashes and cyclist crashes occur in low-income \ncountries ( 4, 59 –61). Pedestrian casualties also \nrepresent a huge cost to society in industrialized \nnations ( 62), where the risks (measured in distance \ntravelled or time spent travelling) are many more \ntimes higher for pedestrians and cyclists than for \ncar users ( 63).\n The crash risks incurred by pedestrians and \ncyclists result from a complex mix of factors. A \nfundamental factor in high-income countries is \nthe fact that the modern trafﬁc system is designed \nlargely from the perspective of a motor vehicle \nuser ( 64). Provision for pedestrians and cyclists in \nlow-income countries is rudimentary or even non-\nexistent.\n The principal risk factor for unprotected road \nusers is the mixing of unprotected people with \nmotor vehicles capable of high speeds ( 5, 60, 65 ). \nThe survival of unprotected users depends upon \nensuring either that they are separated from the \nhigh speeds of motor vehicles or – in the more \ncommon situation of shared use of the road – that \nthe vehicle speed at the point of collision is low \nenough to prevent serious injury on impact with \ncrash-protective safer car fronts. The absence of \nadequate separate pedestrian and cyclist facilities, \nsuch as footpaths or cycle tracks, creates a high risk \nfor these road users.\n If separation is not possible, road management \nand vehicle speed management are essential. At \nlow speeds, drivers have more time to react to \nunexpected events and to avoid collisions. At \nspeeds of less than 30 km/h, pedestrians and \ncyclists can mix with motor vehicles in relative \nsafety ( 51). Poor provision at crossings and junc -\ntions is also a feature of unsafe shared use. In urban \nareas, most fatal or serious cyclist crashes occur at \njunctions ( 66).\n Other risk factors for pedestrians and cyclists \ninclude:\n— poor street visibility;\n— poor understanding on the part of pedes -\ntrians of road safety; in a study in Jordan, \nnearly half of children crossing a road did \nnot check for oncoming trafﬁc even once \nbefore or while crossing ( 67);— alcohol impairment on the part of the \ncyclists or pedestrians;\n— poor design of the fronts of cars ( 6 2, 6 8–71 ).\nYoung drivers and riders\nGlobally, road crash injury is a leading cause of \ndeath for young drivers and riders ( 72). Both \nyoung age and inexperience contribute to the high \nrisk of these drivers and riders. Young drivers have \na higher crash risk than older drivers ( 73). Being a \nyoung male is also predictive of crash involvement \nas a driver. It has been established in industrialized \ncountries that men, especially young men in their \nﬁrst few years of driving, have higher rates of crash \ninvolvement than women, even when corrected for \nexposure factors ( 74).\n In a study of injuries in Australia, Japan, Malay -\nsia and Singapore, the highest injury risk was \nfound among motorcyclists with a provisional \nlicence, followed by those in their ﬁrst year of \nriding ( 75).\n The crash risks for teenage drivers are greater \nthan those for any other comparable age group, \nwith 16-year-old and 17-year-old drivers being \nat particular risk ( 76). Studies in developed coun -\ntries indicate that the risks were particularly high \nduring the 12 months after a full licence had been \nissued ( 76). The factors behind the elevated risk \ninclude:\n— mobility patterns and vehicle characteristics \n(e.g. the vehicle is often borrowed);\n— psychological characteristics, such as thrill-\nseeking and over-conﬁdence;\n— less tolerance of alcohol compared with \nolder people;\n— excess or inappropriate speed, the most \ncommon error among young drivers and \nriders.\n Late-night driving is also a predictive factor for \nserious crashes among young drivers. For 16-year-\nold drivers, the late-night risk is three times the \ndaytime risk (see also Box 3.1). While the night-\ntime risks are greater for the youngest drivers, it is \namong drivers aged 20–44 years that the ratio of \nnight-time driving risk to daytime risk is greatest \n– by a factor of four ( 76).')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 102})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '80 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n The risk for young drivers increases exponen -\ntially as the number of passengers increases ( 76). \nOne case–control study indicated that a third of all \ncrashes involving young drivers might have been \nprevented if young drivers had been restricted to \ndriving with no more than one passenger ( 77).\nAlcohol\nCrash risk\nA case–control study carried out in Michigan, \nUnited States, in 1964, known as the Grand \nRapids study ( 78), showed that drivers who had \nconsumed alcohol had a higher risk of involve -\nment in crashes than those with a zero BAC and \nthat this risk increased rapidly with BAC. These \nresults provided the basis for the future setting of \nlegal blood alcohol limits and breath content lim -\nits in many countries around the world, typically \nat 0.08 g/dl.\n In 1981, an Australian study found that the \nrisk of crash involvement was 1.83 times greater at a BAC of 0.05 g/dl than at a BAC of zero ( 79). \nRe-analysis of the Grand Rapids data by Hurst et \nal. ( 80) also concluded that the risks associated \nwith lower BAC levels were greater than originally \nthought. This information, together with ﬁnd -\nings from behavioural and experimental studies \n(81), provided a justiﬁcation for many countries to \nreduce their legal BAC limits to 0.05 g/dl.\n A major case–control study – using more robust \nresearch design and multivariate analytical tech -\nniques than the Grand Rapids study – has recently \ntaken place to determine at what level of BAC an \nelevated crash risk begins ( 82). This study, involv -\ning 14 985 drivers, was conducted in the United \nStates at Long Beach, California and Fort Lauder -\ndale, Florida. The overall result was in agreement \nwith previous studies showing increasing relative \nrisk as levels of BAC increased (see Figure 3.6). The \nstudy found that the relative risk of crash involve -\nment starts to increase signiﬁcantly at a BAC level \nof 0.04 g/dl.BOX 3.1\nThe human consequences of speed\nJoelle Sleiman is 21 years old and lives in Marjeyoun in southern Lebanon. Her family – including her parents \nand two younger brothers – managed to survive the long civil war without serious incidents. On 16 August 2001, \nthough, they were struck by tragedy when the two sons – Nicolas, 17 years, and Andy, 16 years – were involved \nin a car crash.\n Nicolas loved cars and fast driving. Because of the lack of law enforcement in their area he was able to take \nthe car out without a licence and drive at high speeds. He didn’t listen to his parents’ pleas not to drive.\n On that terrible night, Joelle’s mother was watching television late, waiting for the boys to come home. \nInstead, news of the crash arrived. Joelle and her parents rushed to the hospital, where they found Andy dead \nand Nicolas in a grave condition, not responding to treatment. They managed, with difﬁculty, to have Nicolas \ntransferred to a hospital in Beirut, where he lay in a coma.\n On the same day that Andy’s funeral was held, the father was told that Nicolas’s prospects were not promising. \nThe family spent the next week praying for a miracle, but nothing could be done. Nicolas died one week after \nhis brother. It eventually emerged that the boys were trying to avoid an unknown driver coming at them in the \nwrong direction, when they hit a wall.\n When Joelle talks to other teenagers about speeding, they sometimes say to her, “It is up to us if we choose \nto die”. They forget, Joelle points out, that they are not the only ones affected, that there are parents, brothers, \nsisters and close friends who love them. They should also think about that.\n Losing her two brothers has completely changed Joelle’s life. She now lives alone at home with her parents. \nShe joined the Youth Association for Social Awareness (YASA), which has helped ease her inner pain. While she \nwill not get her brothers back, she says that at least she can help other sisters avoid what she went through. Her \nwork with YASA gives her pride, and she does it thinking of Andy and Nicolas.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 103})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 3.  RISK FACTORS  • 81\n An Australian study of alcohol and motorcycle \ncrashes found that having a BAC level greater than \nzero was associated with ﬁve times the risk relative \nto a zero BAC ( 85).\nAge of drivers\nThe risk of a crash with alcohol varies with age \nand drinking experience. Zador estimated that \ncrash rates of male drivers aged 16–20 years were \nat least three times the estimated crash rate of \nmale drivers aged 25 years and above, for every \nBAC level ( 86). With few exceptions, the relative \nrisk of being fatally injured in a single-vehicle \ncrash was found to decrease with increasing \ndriver age for every BAC level, for both men and \nwomen ( 87).\n A study on drivers killed in road crashes esti -\nmated that teenage drivers had more than ﬁve \ntimes the risk of a crash compared with drivers \naged 30 and above, at all levels of BAC. Drivers \nin the 20–29 years age group were estimated to \nhave a three times higher risk than drivers aged \n30 years and above, at all BAC levels ( 88). Teen -\nage drivers with a BAC of 0.03 g/dl carrying two \nor more passengers were 34 times more at risk of \na crash than drivers aged 30 years or more, with \nzero BAC, driving with one passenger ( 88).Severity of crashes\nA study in the United States of rela -\ntive fatality risks at different BAC \nlevels indicated that for single-vehi -\ncle crashes, each 0.02% increase in \nBAC level approximately doubled \nthe risk of involvement in a fatal \ncrash ( 86). A similar ﬁnding was \nreported in a New Zealand study that \nused a sample of crashes involving \nmainly single vehicles. The study \ncalculated the risk for a driver of a \nfatal injury during the night-time, \naccording to the number of passen -\ngers in the vehicle, the driver’s age \nand the driver’s BAC level ( 88).\n A study in the United Kingdom, \ncomparing data from roadside surveys with the \ncorresponding ranges of BAC levels collected from \ncoroners’ reports, showed that the relative fatality \nrisk increases exponentially with BAC, and that this \nrisk was an order of magnitude larger than the risk \nof being involved in a crash with injuries ( 89).\n The frequency of drinking and driving varies \nconsiderably around the world. Despite that, and \ndespite the fact that there have been few stud -\nies in low-income countries, research indicates \nthat the phenomenon continues to be a major \nrisk factor in trafﬁc crashes. After many years of \ndecline, the rate of road trafﬁc deaths involving \nalcohol has begun rising in several high-income \ncountries ( 90). A review of surveys of drinking \nand driving levels in trafﬁc in European Union \ncountries found that alcohol was present in \nbetween 1% and 3% of drivers ( 91). Roadside \nsurveys taken in Croatia indicated that over 4% \nof drivers were intoxicated ( 92). A Ghanaian \nstudy found that over 7% of drivers in a random \nbreath test had BAC levels above 0.08 g/dl ( 93). \nIn New Delhi, India, a study showed that a third \nof motorized two-wheeler riders taken to hos -\npital admitted to driving under the inﬂuence of \nalcohol ( 94).\n 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10123456Crash risk r elative to zer o BAC\nBlood alcohol concentration (BAC) in g/dlBorkenstein et al., 1964  (78); Allsop, 1966  (83)Compton et al., 2002  (82); Moskowitz et al., 2002  (84)FIGURE 3.6\nRelative risk of driver involvement in police-reported crashes\nSource: references 78, 82–84 .')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 104})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '82 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n The effects of alcohol consumption on the risk \nof crashes and of crash injury are summarized in \nFigure 3.7.Research on the role of alcohol in crashes\nApart from in those countries where alcohol is \nprohibited, impairment by alcohol is likely to \nbe an important factor in causing crashes and \nin exacerbating the consequences of crashes. \nSystematic surveillance, though, is not established \nin many countries ( 96, 97 ). In many low-income \ncountries, the police often lack the means, in terms \nof human resources and equipment, to monitor \nroutinely the level of alcohol in drivers, even where \nlegal limits exist ( 96).\n As Odero and Zwi ( 97) for low-income and \nmiddle-income countries and the European \nTransport Safety Council (ETSC) for Europe ( 91) \nhave outlined, variable measurements; testing for \ndifferent injury severities and different thresh -\nolds for BAC (where they exist), preclude a full \ncomparison of excess alcohol levels between \ncountries. Some studies refer to presence of any \nalcohol, others to alcohol over the legal limit, \nwhere such a limit exists.\n From an investigation of studies conducted in \nlow-income countries, it emerged that alcohol \nwas present in between 33% and 69% of fatally-\ninjured drivers, and in between 8% and 29% of \ndrivers involved in crashes who were not fatally \ninjured ( 97). Peden et al. ( 98) found that alcohol \nwas a factor in around 29% of non-fatally-injured \ndrivers, and in over 47% of fatally-injured drivers \nin South Africa. A later study found excess alco -\nhol in over 52% of trauma patients involved in \nroad crashes ( 99) (see also Box 3.2).� Drivers and motorcyclists with any level of BAC \ngreater than zero are at higher risk of a crash than \nthose whose BAC is zero.\n� For the general driving population, as the BAC \nincreases from zero, the risk of being involved in a crash  \nstarts to rise significantly at a BAC of 0.04 g/dl  (82).\n� Inexperienced young adults driving with a BAC of \n0.05 g/dl have 2.5 times the risk of a crash compared with more experienced drivers (95).\n� A study on drivers killed in road crashes estimated that \nteenage drivers had more than five times the risk of a \ncrash compared with drivers aged 30 and above, at all levels of BAC. Drivers 20–29 years old were estimated to have three times the risk compared with drivers \naged 30 years and above, at all BAC levels (88).\n� Teenage drivers with a BAC of 0.03 g/dl carrying two \nor more passengers were 34 times more at risk of a crash \nthan drivers aged 30 years or more, with zero BAC, \ndriving with one passenger (88).\n� If a BAC limit is fixed at 0.10 g/dl, this will result in \nthree times the risk of a crash that exists with the most common limit, in high-income countries, of 0.05 g/dl. If the legal limit stands at 0.08 g/dl, there will still be twice \nthe risk that there would be with a limit of 0.05 g/dl.\n� Alcohol consumption by drivers puts pedestrians and \nriders of motorized two-wheelers at risk.FIGURE 3.7\nEffects of alcohol on risk of crashes and on crash injury\nBOX 3.2\nAlcohol-related road trafﬁc deaths in South Africa\nAccording to the South African national injury mortality surveillance system, there were 25 361 fatal injuries \nregistered at 32 state mortuaries in 2001. This represents approximately 35% of all non-natural mortality in South \nAfrica in that year. Transport-related deaths accounted for 27% of all the fatal injuries. Pedestrians were the group \nof road users most frequently killed (37.3%), followed by passengers of vehicles (17.4%), drivers (14.0%) and cyclists \n(3.1%).\n Alcohol is a major risk factor for all types of fatal road trafﬁc injury in South Africa.

More than half (51.9%) of all transport-related deaths had \nelevated BAC, and of these positive cases, 91% recorded BAC levels of 0.05 g/dl or higher.\n Pedestrians, followed by drivers, were most likely to be BAC-positive (see table below).')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 105})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 3.  RISK FACTORS  • 83\n Research in the United States indicates that \nmotorized two-wheeler riders have higher intoxi -\ncation rates than motor vehicle drivers ( 100).\n In Sweden, the Netherlands and the United \nKingdom, the proportion of fatally-injured drivers \nwith excess alcohol for each country is around 20%, \nthough the legal limits in these countries differ con -\nsiderably, being 0.02 g/dl, 0.05 g/dl and 0.08 g/dl, \nrespectively ( 101).\nPerception of risk of being caught with excess \nalcohol\nResearch has shown that the only consistently effective \nstrategy for dealing with the problem of excess alco -\nhol is to increase the perceived risk of being caught. \nSuch a perception is considered a better deterrent than \nthe severity or the swiftness of the penalty ( 102). With \na few exceptions – including Australia and the Nordic \ncountries – both the perception and the actual likeli -\nhood of being detected for excess alcohol are low in \nmost countries, irrespective of personal income ( 91). \nIn Thailand, over 80% of people surveyed considered \ntheir chances of being stopped by the police for BAC \ntesting very low, while over 90% accepted the beneﬁt \nof the law being enforced ( 103).\nPedestrians\nAlcohol as a risk factor in pedestrian crashes has \nbeen well documented in high-income countries \nover several decades. Pedestrians impaired by \nalcohol, however, present a different order of risk \nto that of drinking drivers who pose more risks to \nthemselves and others. Clayton et al. established that for pedestrians there \nwas a signiﬁcantly higher risk of fatality relative to \nzero alcohol at BAC levels above 0.1 g/dl ( 104).\n A review of Australian studies of alcohol involve -\nment in pedestrian crashes showed that 20–30% of \npedestrian casualties had a BAC level in excess of \n0.15 g/dl, with alcohol involvement being greater \namong fatalities ( 105). Peden et al. ( 98) found that \nalcohol was a factor in over 61% of fatally-injured \npedestrians in South Africa. A recent study in the \nUnited Kingdom concluded that 48% of pedestrians \nkilled in road trafﬁc collisions had been drinking, \nand that 39% of fatalities were over the legal BAC \nlimit for driving ( 106). The proportion of male and \nfemale injured pedestrians consuming alcohol had \nincreased by a third in the 16–19 years age group, \nwhen compared with ﬁndings from an earlier study \nconducted in 1985–1989 ( 107).\nMedicinal and recreational drugs\nWhile the contribution of alcohol to road crashes is \nmuch greater than that of any other drug, any medi -\ncation or drug that affects the central nervous system \nhas the potential to impair drivers ( 108). The effects, \nthough, of both medicinal and recreational drugs \non driving performance and crash involvement are \nmuch less well understood than those of alcohol, \nespecially for low-income and middle-income coun -\ntries.

Combina -\ntions of drugs may have synergistic effects (e.g. \ncodeine and antipsychotic drugs with alcohol) \nor antagonistic effects. The number of possible \ninteractions is great ( 65, 113).\n Currently, there is no strong evidence that the \nuse of drugs and driving constitutes a signiﬁcant \nroad crash risk. However, there is evidence for the \nincreasing use among drivers of many psychoactive \ndrugs, both medicinal and recreational, often in \nconjunction with alcohol ( 114, 115 ). This is an issue \nthat needs urgent research.\n Although studies support the notion that cannabis induces impairment ( 109), and in some countries \nthere is a growing incidence of cannabis found in the \nblood of fatally-injured drivers, the evidence for its \ncausal relationship with road trafﬁc crashes remains \nundecided ( 109, 116, 117 ). A recent case–control study \nin France, though, found a higher prevalence of alco -\nhol, cannabis and a combination of the two in blood \nsamples from drivers involved in road crashes than in \nthose from controls ( 118). A study in the United King -\ndom also suggested a strong relationship between use \nof alcohol and cannabis together, and a clear reduction \nin driver capability following their use, compared \nwith control data ( 119).\n What is known suggests that drug use is a signiﬁ -\ncant factor in some cultures but inadequate knowledge \nprecludes quantifying the levels of risk at present.  \nThe availability and reliability of blood-screening \nprocedures and conﬁrmation tests for measuring \nalcohol and drug levels are problems for most low-\nincome and middle-income countries.

Three high-risk groups have been \nidentiﬁed ( 121):\n— young people, particularly males, aged \n16–29 years;\n— shift workers whose sleep is disrupted by \nworking at night or working long, irregular \nhours;\n— people with untreated sleep apnoea syn -\ndrome or narcolepsy.\n Estimates of the proportion of car crashes attrib -\nutable to driver sleepiness vary, depending on the \ntype of study and the quality of data. A population-\nbased case–control study in New Zealand found \nthat factors that substantially increased the risk of a \nfatal crash or a crash with serious injuries were:\n— driving while feeling sleepy;\n— driving after less than ﬁve hours of sleep in \nthe preceding 24 hours;\n— driving between 02:00 and 05:00.\n The study concluded that a reduction in all three \nof these behaviours could reduce the incidence of \ncrashes involving injury by up to 19% ( 122).\n Surveys of commercial and public road trans -\nport in developing countries have revealed that \ntransport owners, in pursuit of increased proﬁts, \nfrequently force their drivers to drive at excessive \nspeeds, to work unduly long hours and to work \nwhen exhausted ( 58, 59, 123 ).\n Studies by the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) in the United States found that 52% \nof 107 single-vehicle crashes involving heavy trucks \nwere fatigue-related and that in nearly 18% of the \ncases, the drivers admitted to having fallen asleep. \nThe United States Department of Transportation’s \ninvestigations into fatigue in the 1990s showed that \nfatigue was a factor in about 30% of fatal crashes \ninvolving heavy commercial transport ( 124–126 ).\n In Europe, studies have been less comprehensive, \nand have often involved retrospective accounts that \nwere likely to underestimate the impact of fatigue. \nThese limitations notwithstanding, research from \nsome European countries suggests that driver \nfatigue is a signiﬁcant factor in approximately 20% \nof commercial transport crashes. The results from \na range of surveys show that more than a half of long-haul drivers have at some time fallen asleep at \nthe wheel ( 127).\n Peak levels of fatigue-related crashes at night are \noften 10 times higher than daytime levels. Research \nin France on the working hours and habits of truck \ndrivers ( 128) showed that their risk of crashes \nrelated to fatigue increased when:\n— they were driving at night;\n— the length of their working day had increased;\n— they were working irregular hours.\nHand-held mobile telephones\nThe number of hand-held mobile telephones has \nincreased rapidly in many high-income countries \n– in the United States, for example, from 500 000 \nin 1985 to over 120 million in 2001. Europe has \nalso seen sharp increases in their number ( 129).\n The use of hand-held mobile telephones can \nadversely affect driver behaviour – as regards physical \nas well as perceptual and decision-making tasks. The \nprocess of dialling inﬂuences a driver’s ability to keep \nto the course on the road ( 130). Results of studies on \ndistraction and mental load show that driver reaction \ntimes are increased by 0.5–1.5 seconds when talking \ninto a mobile telephone ( 131, 132 ).\n Studies have shown that driver performance is \nparticularly affected in maintaining the correct \nlane position and the headway between two vehi -\ncles travelling one behind the other, in keeping to \nan appropriate speed, and in judging and accepting \nsafe gaps in the trafﬁc ( 130, 131, 133, 134 ). There is \nalso some evidence from studies that drivers who \nuse mobile telephones while driving face a risk of \na crash four times higher than those who do not \nuse them ( 135). Almost a half of drivers, though, \ninvolved in a crash used a mobile telephone to \ncall for help ( 135). To date, at least 35 countries \nor territories have banned the use of hand-held \nmobile telephones while driving. While the use of \nhands-free telephones can also distract drivers, the \ncurrent evidence suggests that the effect is less than \nthat for hand-held telephones ( 129).\nInadequate visibility\nTo see and be seen is a fundamental prerequisite \nfor the safety of all road users.

"('page_content', '86 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nin Australia, Germany and Japan have shown that \nvisual errors play a very important role in the cause \nof crashes ( 136).\n In highly-motorized countries, inadequate visibil -\nity plays a key role in three types of crashes ( 137):\n— a moving vehicle running into the rear or \nside of a slowly moving or stationary vehicle \nlocated ahead on the roadway, at night-time;\n— angled collisions or head-on collisions in \ndaytime;\n— rear-end collisions in fog, in daytime and at \nnight.\n In low-income and middle-income countries, \nthe phenomenon of pedestrians and vehicles not \nbeing properly visible is frequently a serious prob -\nlem. In these places, there are fewer roads with \nadequate illumination and some may not be lit at \nall. In addition, it is more common for large num -\nbers of bicycles and other vehicles to have no lights \nand for road space to be shared by fast-moving and \nslow-moving road users.\nCars and trucks\nAn analysis of crashes in the state of Victoria, Aus -\ntralia, suggests that not being sufﬁciently visible is \na factor in 65% of crashes between cars and motor -\nized two-wheelers and the sole cause in 21% of \nthem ( 138). A meta-analysis of the effect of using \ndaytime running lights found a 10–15% reduction \nin daytime crashes involving more than one party. \nA few countries currently require the ﬁtting and \nuse of daytime running lights ( 139).\n Research in Germany has shown that nearly 5% \nof severe truck crashes can be traced back to poor \nvisibility of the truck or its trailer at night. In these \ncases, car drivers failed to recognize trucks turning \noff the road, turning around or driving ahead of \nthem ( 140).\n A number of crashes involve drivers who fail to \nsee other road users in the blind spots that exist in \nthe area immediately around their vehicles. When \nlarger vehicles such as trucks or buses are involved, \nthese crashes frequently lead to serious injuries or \neven fatalities among vulnerable road users, such as \npedestrians, cyclists or drivers of motorized two-\nwheelers ( 141).Motorized two-wheelers\nMotorized two-wheelers, because of their size and \nshape, are less easy to see than other motor vehicles \nand have poor visibility in daytime ( 142). A study \nin Malaysia found that most motorcycle crashes \nwere in daytime and that around two-thirds of the \nriders involved had the right of way ( 143). Motor -\nized two-wheelers that use daytime running lights \nhave a crash rate about 10–29% lower than those \nthat do not ( 66, 144 ).\nPedestrians and cyclists\nIn low-income countries, the mix of motorized \nand non-motorized trafﬁc, together with frequent \npoor lighting, leads to a high risk for unprotected \nusers if they are not seen by trafﬁc. Lack of access to \nretro-reﬂective equipment, absence of bicycle lamp \nﬁtment, and use of darkly coloured bicycle helmets \nexacerbate already unsafe conditions. A review of \nEuropean in-depth research found that one third \nof pedestrian casualties had difﬁculty in seeing the \nstriking vehicle. Similarly, two ﬁfths of drivers had \ndifﬁculty in seeing the pedestrian ( 63). The more \nconspicuous a particular motor vehicle is to all other \nroad users, and the more visible the other road \nusers are to the particular driver, then the greater \nthe opportunity of avoiding a collision. More than \n30% of bicycle crashes in the Netherlands occurring \nat night or in twilight could have been avoided, it is \nestimated, if bicycle lighting had been used ( 145).\nRoad-related factors\nRoad crashes tend not to be evenly distributed \nthroughout the network. They occur in clusters at sin -\ngle sites, along particular sections of road, or scattered \nacross whole residential neighbourhoods, especially \nin areas of social deprivation ( 146). While road engi -\nneering can greatly help in reducing the frequency and \nseverity of road trafﬁc crashes, poor engineering can \ncontribute to crashes. The road network has an effect \non crash risk because it determines how road users \nperceive their environment and provides instructions \nfor road users, through signs and trafﬁc controls, on \nwhat they should be doing. Many trafﬁc management \nand road safety engineering measures work through \ntheir inﬂuence on human behaviour ( 6).')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 109})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 3.  RISK FACTORS  • 87\n Negative road engineering factors include those \nwhere a road defect directly triggers a crash, where \nsome element of the road environment misleads a \nroad user and thereby creates error, or where some \nfeasible physical alteration to the road that would have \nmade the crash less likely has not been made( 147).\n In the planning, design and maintenance of the \nroad network, four particular elements affecting \nroad safety have been identiﬁed ( 148). These ele -\nments are:\n— safety-awareness in the planning of new \nroad networks;\n— the incorporation of safety features in the \ndesign of new roads;\n— safety improvements to existing roads;\n— remedial action at high-risk crash sites.\n The absence of any of these elements, discussed \nbelow, are risk factors for crashes.\nInattention to safety in planning new road \nnetworks\nAs already mentioned, crash risks in road networks \nare frequently increased by the existence of unnec -\nessary motorized travel, by policies encouraging \ntravel by less safe modes, and by the creation of \nunsafe mixes of travel ( 5).\n Speciﬁc situations related to road planning that \nare risk factors for crashes include ( 5, 148 ):\n— through-trafﬁc passing through residential \nareas;\n— conﬂicts between pedestrians and vehicles \nnear schools located on busy roads;\n— lack of segregation of pedestrians and high-\nspeed trafﬁc;\n— lack of median barriers to prevent dangerous \novertaking on single-carriageway roads;\n— lack of barriers to prevent pedestrian access \nonto high-speed dual-carriageway roads.\n The growth in urbanization and in the number \nof motorized vehicles in many low-income and \nmiddle-income countries has not been accompa -\nnied by adequate attention to road design. \nInattention to safety in designing roads\nWhere road layouts are self-explanatory to their \nusers – through the use of markings, signs and physically self-enforcing measures to reduce speed \n– engineering can have a beneﬁcial inﬂuence on \nbehaviour. Engineering design, though, can often \nhave negative inﬂuences on behaviour – when \nthere is incompatibility between the function of \nthe roads, their layout and their use, this creates \nrisk for road users.\n Uncertainty among road users about the layout of \nroads – through the absence of clear and unambigu -\nous markings and signs – is a particular risk factor \nfor crashes. Similarly, the lack of self-enforcing \nmeasures to reduce speed will increase the risk. \n Straight, unmarked single-carriageway roads \nencourage drivers to speed. Other risk factors are \nthe poor design and control of junctions and insuf -\nﬁcient lighting.\nSafety defects in existing roads\nDefects contributing to crash risk can appear in \nroad designs, especially if they have not been \nsubject to a safety audit by experienced safety per -\nsonnel. Such defects are frequently caused by the \npoor design of junctions or by design that allows \nfor large differences in the speed and the mass of \nvehicles and in the direction of travel.\n Bad road surface conditions are a particular risk \nfactor for users of motorized two-wheelers. Often, \nwhere there is no safety impact study to assess \nthe effects of a new road scheme on the existing \nnetwork, a new road scheme can have an adverse \nimpact on large areas. \nLack of remedial action at high-risk crash sites\nLarge numbers of high-risk crash sites exist every -\nwhere, located either at isolated spots or grouped \nalong particular stretches of road. Many of them \nare well-known and documented. Some 145 dan -\ngerous locations, for example, have been identiﬁed \non Kenya’s main rural road network ( 149). If such \nsites are not dealt with, promptly and systemati -\ncally, there will be a great risk of further crashes.\n A survey of 12 European Union countries found \nthat many of them lacked comprehensive remedial \nprogrammes for high-risk sites ( 147).

In low-income countries, the regulation of motor \nvehicle safety standards is not as systematic as in \nhigh-income countries. Many engineering advances \nthat are found in vehicles available in high-income \ncountries are not standard ﬁttings in vehicles in low-\nincome countries ( 4). In addition, the majority of road \ncasualties in low-income countries occur outside the \ncar, with those affected being pedestrians, cyclists, \nmotorized two-wheeled vehicle riders or passengers \nin buses and trucks. As yet, there are no requirements \nto protect vulnerable road users by means of crash -\nworthy designs for the fronts of cars or buses ( 61).\nCar occupants\nThe main injury risks for car occupants arise from \nthe way vehicles interact with each other and with \nthe roadside in frontal and side-impact crashes. In \nfatal and serious crashes, head, chest and abdomi -\nnal injuries are predominant. Among injuries that \ncause disablement, those to the legs and neck are \nimportant. Determinants for the degree of severity \nof injuries include:\n— contact by occupant with the car’s interior, \nexacerbated by intrusion into the passenger \ncompartment caused by the colliding vehicle \nor object;\n— mismatch in terms of size and weight \nbetween vehicles involved in a crash;\n— ejection from the vehicle;\n— inadequate vehicle safety standards.\n The European Commission has stated that if all \ncars were designed to be equal in standard to the \nbest car currently available in each class, then an \nestimated 50% of all fatal and disabling injuries \ncould be avoided ( 53).\n The relationship between vehicle age and risk \nof a car crash with injury has recently been inves -\ntigated. The study showed that occupants in cars \nmanufactured before 1984 have approximately \nthree times the risk of a car crash injury compared \nwith occupants of newer cars ( 156).\nPedestrians\nCrashes between vehicles and pedestrians are \nresponsible for more than a third of all trafﬁc-related \ndeaths and injuries worldwide ( 62).

In India, in the \ncities and on rural highways, buses and trucks are \ninvolved in more than 50% of the crashes affect -\ning pedestrians ( 158). The distribution of differ -\nent vehicle types involved in pedestrian crashes \nin Ghana, shown in Table 3.6, is fairly typical for \nlow-income countries. In Ghana, car-to-pedes -\ntrian impacts are the leading cause of pedestrian \ndeath and injury, followed by collisions of buses or \nminibuses with pedestrians.\n There are usually two phases in car-to-pedes -\ntrian collisions. The ﬁrst and most severe phase \nconsists of multiple impacts with different parts of \nthe car front. The second phase is contact with the \nroad surface, where injuries are generally minor \n(159).\n The most frequent causes of serious and fatal \npedestrian injuries in collisions with cars stem \nfrom impacts between ( 160):— the head of the pedestrian and the whole \narea of the car bonnet top and windscreen \nframe;\n— the pelvis or the abdomen of adults and the \nbonnet edge;\n— the abdomen or chest of children or the head \nof small children and the bonnet edge;\n— the legs and the car bumper.\n In general, lower-limb trauma is the most com -\nmon form of pedestrian injury, while head injury \nis responsible for most pedestrian fatalities ( 62).\n Results from both the Australian and the Euro -\npean New Car Assessment Programmes, using \nfour performance tests, indicate that, in general, \nthe new cars tested did not provide protection for \npedestrians and cyclists ( 161, 162 ).\nUsers of motorized two-wheelers\nHospital studies in Thailand show that 75–80% \nof road casualties and 70–90% of road deaths are \namong motorized two-wheeler users ( 15).\n Motorized two-wheeler users tend to sustain \nmultiple injuries, including to the head, chest \nand legs. The majority of the fatal injuries are to \nthe head. Lower-leg injuries – either from direct \ncontact with the impacting vehicle or as a result of \nbeing crushed – contribute substantially to mor -\nbidity ( 163). A Malaysian study found that leg inju -\nries usually required a longer period of inpatient \nstay than other non-fatal injuries ( 164).\n Considerable research has been conducted in \nEurope to identify effective leg protection for \nmotorized two-wheeler riders and to develop suit -\nable air bags to protect riders in case of a frontal \nimpact ( 165).\nBus and truck occupants\nBuses with passengers, minibuses and trucks are \nfrequently involved in crashes in low-income \ncountries. The use of open-backed vehicles for \ntransporting passengers in rural areas is wide -\nspread and risks ejecting passengers ( 166).

Such vehicles have a poor crashworthi -\nness performance, and also poor stability when fully \nladen or overloaded, as they frequently are.\n The urban centres of low-income and middle-\nincome countries typically contain a great mix of \nvehicles. Incompatibility of size between different \nclasses of road vehicles is a major risk factor, espe -\ncially in impacts between cars and large trucks. The \npower of the larger vehicle – its mass, geometry \nand structural properties – increases rates of injury \nand death many times compared with an equiva -\nlent car-to-car crash ( 71, 167 ).\n Safer bus and truck fronts have been identi -\nﬁed as an urgent need ( 71, 141, 168 ). A study in \nNew Delhi showed that of 359 crashes involving \ntrucks, 55% also involved vulnerable road users. \nImpacts between the fronts of trucks and pedes -\ntrians resulted in severe leg injuries at 25 km/h. \nAt 35 km/h the head sustained severe injuries, as \ndid the chest at 45 km/h. Contact with bumpers \nresulted in pelvic injury ( 141).\nNon-use of crash helmets by two-wheeled \nvehicle users\nUsers of motorized two-wheelers\nThe main risk factor for motorized two-wheeler \nusers is the non-use of crash helmets. Use of hel -\nmets has been shown to reduce fatal and serious \nhead injuries by between 20% and 45% and to be \nthe most successful approach for preventing injury \namong motorized two-wheeler riders ( 169).\n Head trauma is the main cause of death and \nmorbidity in motorized two-wheeler users, \ncontributing to around 75% of motorized two-\nwheeler deaths in European countries ( 170). Fatal \nhead injury resulting from crashes is estimated to \naccount for 55–88% of motorized two-wheeler \nrider deaths in Malaysia ( 171). Substantial growths \nin motorized two-wheeler use in low-income and \nmiddle-income countries are being accompanied \nby an increase in head injuries.\n Kulanthayan et al. ( 172) found that non-  \nhelmeted motorized two-wheeler users were \nthree times more likely to sustain head injuries in a crash than those wearing helmets. A study \nof crash victims admitted to a neurosurgery ward \nin New Delhi, India showed that riders who used \nany type of helmet with some protective padding \nbeneﬁted ( 94). Helmet use varies from slightly \nover zero in some low-income countries to almost \n100% in places where laws on helmet use are \neffectively enforced. Helmets constructed in some \nlow-income and middle-income countries are not \nalways appropriately designed. In some countries, \nsuch as Malaysia, special exemptions from wearing \na helmet are given to certain religious groups, such \nas Sikhs. In several low-income countries, helmet \nuse has been found to be lower at night ( 173, 174 ). \nThough the wearing of helmets has generally been \nwidespread in most high-income countries, there \nis some evidence of a decline. In the United States, \nfor example, helmet use fell sharply to 58% in 2002 \nfrom 71% recorded two years previously ( 175).\n Studies in low-income countries have found that \nmore than half of adult motorized two-wheeler \nriders do not wear their helmets properly secured \n(172, 176 ). Child passengers rarely wear helmets \nand if helmets are used at all they are likely to \nbe adult helmets, providing almost no protection \n(177). A study in California, United States, found \nthat nearly half of motorcyclists used non-stand -\nard helmets and that these riders incurred more \nfrequent head injuries than those who wore either \nstandard helmets or no helmets at all ( 178).\nBicycle helmets\nAdmissions to hospital and deaths from bicycle-\nrelated trauma are usually due to head injury ( 179). \nBicycle helmets reduce the risk of head and brain \ninjuries by between 63% and 88% ( 180–182 ).\n A meta-analysis of studies on the beneﬁts of \nbicycle helmets found that wearing a helmet had an \nodds-ratio efﬁcacy of 0.40, 0.42, 0.53 and 0.27 for \nhead, brain, facial and fatal injuries, respectively \n(183).\n Several countries have introduced legislation \non bicycle helmet wearing, including Australia, \nNew Zealand, Sweden and the United States.

The most frequent and most \nserious injuries occurring in frontal impacts to \noccupants unrestrained by seat-belts are to the \nhead ( 185).

For \nexample, while the overall proportion of occupants \nwearing seat-belts in trafﬁc is around 90%, only \naround 55% of drivers in fatal crashes in Finland wore \nseat-belts ( 189), and about 35% in Sweden ( 190).\n While seat-belts may cause injuries, these are, \ntypically, minor abrasions and bruising to the chest \nand abdomen, and without the seat-belts the injuries \nwould have been far more severe ( 191). The effec -\ntiveness of front seat-belts in a frontal collision is \nreduced by the rear loading caused by unrestrained \npassengers in the back seat. This phenomenon of \nrear loading can cause severe chest injuries to the \noccupants of front seats. It can also occur when there \nTABLE 3.7 \nInjury reduction beneﬁts of seat-belts for car drivers and front-seat passengers \nYear Reference Injury reducing effect (%)\nFatal collisions Moderate and severe injuries All severities\n1976 Grifﬁth et al. 41\n1984 Hobbs & Mills  65\n1986 Department of Transport, USA 40–50\n1987 Malliaris & Digges 50 (drivers)\n40 (front-seat passengers)\n1987 Evans 41\n1987 Campbell 65 (drivers)\n54 (front-seat passengers)51–52 (drivers) \n43–44 (front-seat passengers)\n1996 National Highway Trafﬁc Safety  \nAdministration, USA48\n1996 Cooperative Crash Injury Study, UK (unpublished) 53\n2003 Cummings et al.  61\nEffectiveness range 40–65 43–65 40–50\nSource: reproduced from references 186, 187.\nis unrestrained luggage on the rear seats.

In many low-\nincome countries, there is no requirement for belts \nto be ﬁtted in motor vehicles or to be used. Despite \nlegislation, though, the extent of non-use remains \nsigniﬁcant in highly-motorized countries, with \nlow rates of front seat-belt wearing in some places \nand generally low rates of rear seat-belt wearing. In \nthe United States, front seat-belt use was reported \nin 2002 as 75%, compared with 58% in 1994 ( 175). \nIn European Union countries in the mid-1990s, \nwearing rates of front seat-belts ranged between \n52% and 92%, and those of rear seat-belts between \n9% and 80% ( 186).\n In the Republic of Korea, rates of seat-belt usage \nrose sharply among drivers, from 23% in late 2000 \nto 98% in August 2001, following a national cam -\npaign of police enforcement together with publicity  \nand a doubling of the ﬁne for non-use ( 195).  \nIn many other places, including some eastern \nEuropean countries and parts of Central and South \nAmerica, usage rates are generally much lower. \nIn Argentina, for instance, front seat-belt use is \naround 26% in the capital Buenos Aires and 58% \non national highways ( 196).\n A survey in Kenya found that of over 200 road \ncrash survivors only 1% reported seat-belt use, \nleading the authors of the study to conclude that \n“the demand for seat-belts has yet to become part \nof the culture in Kenya” ( 59).\n In some countries, usage among drivers tends \nto be high on motorways but low in urban areas. \nYoung male drivers have been found to use their \nsafety belts less often than other groups and are \nalso more often involved in crashes ( 197).\nChild restraints\nMethods of restraining children in motor vehicles, \nand in particular the use of child safety seats, vary \nwithin and between countries. In high-income \ncountries, usage rates of child restraints tend to \nbe high – about 90% in Australia and 86% in the \nUnited States. In car travel in low-income coun -\ntries, though, their use is rare.\n Child restraints work in the same way as adult \nseat-belts. Rear-facing seats have been shown to be \nparticularly effective (see Table 3.9). When travel -ling rearwards, the forces from a sudden decelera -\ntion will be distributed over the child’s body and \nhead in an optimal way, which markedly increases \neffectiveness.\n In terms of preventing fatalities, the use of safety \nseats for children travelling in cars offers a very high \nlevel of protection. It has been shown to reduce infant \ndeaths in cars by approximately 71% and deaths of \nsmall children by 54% ( 198). Nevertheless even when \nrestrained, children in cars face a particular risk \nfrom side impacts. A study in Sweden showed that \napproximately 50% of fatally-injured children aged \nup to 3 years had been involved in side impact colli -\nsions ( 199). The European New Car Assessment Pro -\ngramme has also shown that current restraints, when \nﬁtted in cars, do not fully constrain the movement of  \nthe child’s head and prevent contact with the car’s  \ninterior ( 154).\nAir bags\nDriver air bags are designed to provide protec -\ntion for belted and unbelted occupants in frontal \ncrashes. Estimates of their effectiveness in reducing \ndriver deaths in purely frontal crashes range from \n22% to 29% ( 187, 200–202 ).\n The potential hazard of combining air bags with \nrear-facing child safety seats in the front seat was \nﬁrst reported in 1974 by Aldman et al. ( 203), and \nmore recently by Anund ( 204) and Weber ( 205). In \nthe United States, there have been many cases of \nfatally injured and severely injured children where \nthe injuries – attributed to air bags that inﬂated dur -\ning low-speed car crashes – might not otherwise \nhave been sustained. Given the popularity of rear-\nfacing child safety seats in Europe and the almost \nuniversal practice in high-income countries of ﬁtting \nair bags on the front passenger side of the vehicle, TABLE 3.9 \nInjury reduction beneﬁts of child restraints\nType of restraint All injuries (%) Severe injuries (%)\nRearward facing 76 92\nForward facing 34 60\nSource: reproduced from reference 186, with the permission of \nthe publisher.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 115})","('type', 'Document')"

RISK FACTORS  • 93\naction has recently been taken in some places to leg -\nislate for the provision of warning labels in cars and \nof automatic sensors that can detect the presence of \noccupants seated in front of the air bag.\n Studies have shown that there is a substantial \namount of incorrect use of both adult seat-belts \nand child restraints, which markedly lessens their \npotential to reduce injury ( 206, 207 ).\nRoadside objects\nImpacts between vehicles leaving the road and solid \nroadside objects such as trees, poles and road signs \nare a major road safety problem worldwide. Accord -\ning to research in Australia and several European \nUnion countries, roadside hazards contribute to \nbetween 18% and 42% of fatal crashes ( 208, 209 ).\n These collisions are usually single-vehicle \ncrashes and frequently involve young drivers, \nexcess or inappropriate speed, the use of alcohol \nor driver fatigue. Another problem related to \nimpacts with objects off the road is the occurrence \nof crashes caused by restricted visibility, due to the \npoor siting of these objects.\n The linkages between vehicle crash protection \nand roadside crash protection need to be strength -\nened. For example, cars do not provide protection \nfor occupants in head-on collisions at speeds above \n60–70 km/h (or even lower limits with other types \nof impact), although many cars travel at these and \nhigher speeds. For this reason, the road environ -\nment needs to be designed so as to eliminate head-\non collisions – into trees, poles and other rigid \nobjects – at high speeds, where the car itself cannot \noffer sufﬁcient protection. Cars, roads and other \naspects of the trafﬁc system must be designed in a \nmutually-linked way ( 155).\nRisk factors inﬂuencing post-crash \ninjury outcome\nStudies worldwide have shown that death was \npotentially preventable in a large proportion of \nthose who died as a result of road crashes before \nthey reached hospital ( 210, 211 ).\n A review of European studies of mortality in \nroad trafﬁc concluded that about 50% of deaths \nfrom road collisions occurred within a few min -utes at the scene of the crash, or else on the way \nto a hospital but before arrival there. For those \npatients taken to hospital, the data suggest that \ncomparatively few deaths, only about 15%, occur \nbetween one and four hours after the incident, \nwhile around 35% occur after four hours. The \ntime between the incident and death varies con -\nsiderably between patients and between countries \n(212).\n A comparative study of mortality among seri -\nously injured patients across a range of countries \nfound that for low-income and middle-income \ncountries, the vast majority of deaths occurred \nin the pre-hospital phase (see Table 3.10). The \nstudy also showed clearly that the probability of \ndying increased as the socioeconomic level of the \nvictim decreased ( 213). Morbidity outcomes are \nalso inﬂuenced by factors related to post-impact \ncare. A study in the United Kingdom, for instance, \nsuggested that 12% of patients who had sustained \nserious skeletal trauma went on to experience sig -\nniﬁcant disability that was preventable ( 214).\n In the case of major injuries, the potential help \ntowards recovery that survivors can receive can be \nviewed as a chain with several links ( 212):\n— actions, or self-help, at the scene of the \ncrash, by the victims themselves, or more \nfrequently by bystanders;\n— access to the emergency medical system;\n— help provided by rescuers of the emergency \nservices;\n— delivery of medical care before arrival at the \nhospital;\n— hospital trauma care;\n— rehabilitative psychosocial care.TABLE 3.10 \nProportion of road deaths by setting in three cities \nSetting Kumasi, Ghana\n(%)Monterrey, \nMexico\n(%)Seattle, USA\n(%)\nPre-hospital 81 72 59\nEmergency room   5 21 18\nHospital ward 14   7 23\nSource:  reference 213.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 116})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '94 • WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nPre-hospital factors\nWeak public health infrastructure in many low-\nincome and middle-income countries is a major \nrisk factor. In high-income countries, the pre-hos -\npital risk factors are not so pronounced, but where \nthey exist, are associated with the need to improve \nthe existing elements of post-impact care. In most \nhighly-motorized countries, the large volume of \ntrafﬁc and the high incidence of mobile telephones \nusually lead to the early alerting of the medical \nservices about a crash. However, in low-income \ncountries, most of the population does not have \naccess to even the most basic form of emergency \nmedical service. Evacuation and transport to hos -\npital is more often carried out by bystanders, rela -\ntives, commercial vehicles or the police ( 215). An \nAfrican study found that the police and hospital \nambulances evacuated only 5.5% and 2.9%, respec -\ntively, of crash victims in Kenya ( 216).\n Research in the United States has shown that the \ntransport by ambulance can be a risk, as a result \nof the high speeds of travel and the frequent lack \nof available restraint. Compared with police cars \nand ﬁre trucks, ambulances experience the greatest \nproportion of fatal crashes in which occupants are \nkilled as well as the greatest proportion of crashes \nin which occupants are injured ( 217).\n In low-income countries, many victims do not \npossess social security, health cover or life insur -\nance and therefore lack access to hospital care ( 59, \n60). In a study carried out in Ghana, overall hospi -\ntal use was found to be very low, with only 27% of \nall injured people using hospital services. Among \nthose with severe injuries, only 60% of urban casu -\nalties and 38% of rural casualties received hospital \ncare ( 210).\nHospital care factors\nLack of trained expertise in trauma care\nTrauma treatment in high-income countries is \nusually seen as a chain of care performed by well-\ntrained practitioners, even if many of its elements \nhave room for improvement ( 212, 213 ). In low-\nincome countries, the post-impact chain of care is \noften delivered by personnel lacking formal train -\ning. A study in Mexico showed that this was the case throughout much of the emergency medical \nservices ( 218). In Ghana, a study of 11 rural hos -\npitals that received large numbers of road trafﬁc \ncasualties was staffed exclusively by general practi -\ntioners without trauma training ( 210).\n A further risk factor in low-income countries is \nthe lack of sufﬁcient numbers of formally trained \nsurgeons. In the late 1980s, it was estimated there \nwere 50 surgeons per 100 000 people in the United \nStates, as opposed to only 7 per 100 000 in Latin \nAmerica and 0.5 per 100 000 in Africa ( 219).\n A study of 2000 trauma admissions in the main \nhospital in Kumasi, Ghana, found a mean 12-hour \ndelay before the start of emergency surgery as well \nas low rates of usage of key equipment, despite its \navailability ( 210).\nLack of equipment\nAdequate trauma care requires a range of medical \nspecialities and equipment, as well as appropriate \nlogistic support to ensure that the equipment and \nother specialities are available to the patient on \narrival. In reality, delays are substantial and frequent, \nintroducing avoidable risks of complications.\n In the study of 11 Ghanaian hospitals, essen -\ntial low-cost and reusable equipment was lacking \n– because of poor organization rather than the \ncost. For example, no hospital had chest tubes and \nonly four had equipment to ensure a patent airway \n(210). In Kenya, in a survey of hospital adminis -\ntrators, only 40% of the health facilities – both \noutpatient and inpatient services – were reported \nto be well prepared and have key supplies available \n(216).\nConclusion\nAnalysis of available crash data and other road traf -\nﬁc research show that while the main road safety \nproblems experienced in various parts of the world \noften differ in quality and quantity, they have \nmany characteristics in common. The dominant, \ncommon characteristics of the risks associated with \nroad trafﬁc are as follows:\n• Unnecessary travel, the choice of less safe \ntravel modes and routes, and unsafe mixes of \ntrafﬁc all lead to increased risk.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 117})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 3.  RISK FACTORS  • 95\n• The design of roads and road networks is an \nimportant factor. Exposure to risk is increased \nsigniﬁcantly by road networks failing to route \nheavy trafﬁc around populated areas or to \nseparate pedestrians from motorized trafﬁc.\n• Excess and inappropriate speed is widespread \nand may contribute to around 30% of road \ntrafﬁc crashes and deaths. In collisions at \n80 km/h, car occupants run a 20 times higher \nrisk of being killed than at 30 km/h. Pedes -\ntrians have a 90% chance of surviving car \ncrashes at 30 km/h or below, but less than a \n50% chance of surviving impacts at 45 km/h \nor above.\n• Impairment by alcohol continues to contribute \nto crash injury and increases the risk. All non-\nzero BAC levels carry more risk than zero BAC, \nand crash risk starts to rise sharply at levels of \n0.04 g/dl. Legal BAC limits set at 0.10 g/dl \nallow three times more risk than limits set \nat 0.05 g/dl; at 0.08 g/dl, the risk is twice as \nmuch as that at 0.05 g/dl.\n• Young novice drivers are at increased risk of \ncrash injury; the risk among teenage drivers is \nhigher than among any other comparable age \ngroup. Excess or inappropriate speed is a com -\nmon contributory factor in crashes involving \nyoung drivers. \n• Pedestrians, cyclists and motorized two-\nwheeler users bear a disproportionate share \nof the global road injury burden and are all at \nhigh risk of crash injury.\n• For all road users, the risk of crash injury is \nincreased by failing to see and failing to be \nseen. If daytime running lights were ﬁtted \nand used, almost a third of all motorized \ntwo-wheeler crashes involving lack of vis -\nibility could be avoided; in the case of cars, \nmore than 10% of such crashes could be \navoided.\n• The non-use of seat-belts and child restraints \nmore than doubles the risk of serious and fatal \ninjury, as does the non-use of bicycle helmets. \nSimilarly, the non-use of crash helmets by \nmotorized two-wheeler users almost doubles \ntheir risk of serious or fatal head injury.• Crash analysis shows that the majority of pedes -\ntrian fatalities involve impact with unprotective \ncar fronts. If all cars were designed to provide \nprotection equivalent to that of the best car in \nthe same class, an estimated half of all fatal and \ndisabling injuries to car occupants would be \navoided. Roadside design and the positioning \nof roadside objects play key roles in determin -\ning crash injury, as well as inﬂuencing the \nbehaviour of road users.\n• Inadequate post-crash care is a major problem \nin many places. The availability and quality of \nsuch care has a substantial effect on whether \na road trafﬁc injury leads to subsequent death \nor disability.\n The availability in low-income countries of data \non road trafﬁc crashes is often basic. For a proper \nunderstanding of the risk factors predominating \nin local settings, more investment for systematic, \nindependent and high-quality research is needed, \nparticularly from high-income countries. Such \nworldwide research into the causes of crashes and \ncrash injury is essential for achieving safer trafﬁc \nsystems.\nReferences\n1.  Tingvall C. The Zero Vision.

"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 4.  INTERVENTIONS  • 109\nA road trafﬁc system designed for \nsafe, sustainable use\nRoad trafﬁc deaths and serious injuries are to a \ngreat extent preventable, since the risk of incurring \ninjury in a crash is largely predictable and many \ncountermeasures, proven to be effective, exist. \nRoad trafﬁc injury needs to be considered along -\nside heart disease, cancer and stroke as a prevent -\nable public health problem that responds well to \ntargeted interventions ( 1).\n The provision of safe, sustainable and affordable \nmeans of travel is a key objective in the planning \nand design of road trafﬁc systems. To achieve it \nrequires ﬁrm political will, and an integrated \napproach involving close collaboration of many \nsectors, in which the health sector plays a full and \nactive role. In such a systems-based approach, it \nis possible at the same time to tackle other major \nproblems associated with road trafﬁc, such as con -\ngestion, noise emission, air pollution and lack of \nphysical exercise ( 2). \n Progress is being made in many parts of the \nworld where multisectoral strategic plans are \nleading to incremental reductions in the number \nof road deaths and injuries ( 3, 4). Such strategies \naddress the three prime elements of the trafﬁc sys -\ntem – vehicles, road users and the road infrastruc -\nture. Vehicle and road engineering measures need \nto take into account the safety needs and physi -\ncal limitations of road users. Vehicle technology \nneeds to consider roadside equipment. Measures \ninvolving the road infrastructure must be compat -\nible with the characteristics of vehicles. Vehicle \nmeasures should be complemented by appropriate \nbehaviour on the part of road users, such as wear -\ning seat-belts. In all these strategies, managing \nspeed is a fundamental factor.\n This chapter provides an overview of the wide \nrange of interventions for road safety, examining what \nis known about their practicability, effectiveness, cost \nand acceptability to the public. Proven interventions \nin one setting, of course, may not easily be transfer -\nable elsewhere, but will instead require careful adap -\ntation and evaluation. Where effective interventions \nare altogether lacking, scientiﬁc research is needed to \ndevelop and test new measures.Managing exposure to risk \nthrough transport and land-use \npolicies\nPerhaps the least used of all road safety intervention \nstrategies are those that aim to reduce exposure to \nrisk. Yet the underlying factors determining expo -\nsure to risk can have important effects ( 5). While \nfurther research is required to fully explore inter -\nvention strategies, it is known that exposure to \nroad injury risk can be decreased by strategies that \ninclude:\n— reducing the volume of motor vehicle trafﬁc \nby means of better land use;\n— providing efﬁcient networks where the \nshortest or quickest routes coincide with the \nsafest routes;\n— encouraging people to switch from higher-\nrisk to lower-risk modes of transport;\n— placing restrictions on motor vehicle users, \non vehicles, or on the road infrastructure.\n The impact of strategies aimed at inﬂuencing \nmobility and access tends to be cumulative and \nmutually reinforcing, and such strategies can most \neffectively be implemented in combination. In \nhigh-income countries, it has been estimated that a \ncomprehensive programme with a complementary \nset of cost-effective measures could reduce the total \namount of car travel, per capita, by 20–40% ( 6). \nMany countries are now addressing these issues, \nmainly in the interests of sustainable mobility. \nBogotá in Colombia, for instance, has attempted \nto reduce exposure to risk through measures that \ninclude a mass transit programme for vulnerable \nroad users and restrictions on motor vehicle access \nto the city during certain times ( 7, 8).\nReducing motor vehicle trafﬁc\nEfﬁcient land use\nThe organization of land use affects the number of \ntrips people make, by what means they choose to \ntravel, the length of trips and the route taken ( 9). \nDifferent land use creates different sets of trafﬁc \npatterns ( 10). The main aspects of land use that \ninﬂuence road safety are ( 9):\n— the spatial distribution of origins and desti -\nnations of road journeys;')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 132})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '110 •  WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n— urban population density and patterns of \nurban growth;\n— the conﬁguration of the road network;\n— the size of residential areas;\n— alternatives to private motorized transport.\n Land-use planning practices and “smart \ngrowth” land-use policies – development of \nhigh-density, compact buildings with easily acces -\nsible services and amenities – can serve to lessen \nthe exposure risk of road users. The creation of \nclustered, mixed-use community services, for \nexample, can cut the distances between commonly \nused destinations, curtailing the need to travel and \nreducing dependence on private motor vehicles \n(6).\nSafety impact assessments of transport and \nland-use plans\nEvaluations of the impact on safety of transport \nprojects usually focus on the individual project, \nwith little consideration of the effect on the \nwider network ( 11). This can result in strategies \nfor improving mobility, reducing congestion and \nimproving the environment that are incompatible \nwith road safety. The likely effects of planning \ndecisions to do with transport or land use on \nthe whole of the road network should therefore be \nconsidered at an early stage, to avoid unintended, \nadverse consequences for road safety ( 9, 10, 12 ). \n Area-wide safety impact assessments should \nbe routinely conducted at the same time as other \nassessments of policies and projects related to \ntransport and land use. Safety impact assessments \nare not yet carried out either routinely or system -\natically in most places, though there has been expe -\nrience with them in the Netherlands, and to some \nextent elsewhere ( 13).\nProviding shorter, safer routes\nIn an efﬁcient road network, exposure to crash risk \ncan be minimized by ensuring that trips are short \nand routes direct, and that the quickest routes are \nalso the safest routes. Route management tech -\nniques can achieve these objectives by decreasing \ntravel times on desired routes, increasing travel \ntimes on undesired routes, and re-directing traf -ﬁc (14). Having to take a detour in a car means \nthat extra fuel will be used, but for pedestrians \nit means extra physical exertion. There is thus a \nstrong incentive to ﬁnd the easiest and most direct \nroute. Studies have, in fact, shown that pedestrians \nand cyclists place a higher value on journey time \nthan do drivers or those using public transport – a \nﬁnding that should be reﬂected in planning deci -\nsions ( 15, 16 ).\n Safe crossing facilities for pedestrians and \ncyclists are likely not to be used if many steps need \nto be climbed, if long detours are involved, or if \nthe crossings are poorly lit or underpasses badly \nmaintained. A study in Brazil showed that many \npedestrians who had been struck by vehicles had \nchosen to climb over central trafﬁc-lane barriers, \nrather than climb a ﬂight of stairs to a footbridge \n(17). Interviews with pedestrian crash survivors in \nMexico found that one of the main underlying risk \nfactors was the presence of bridges that were poorly \nlocated or regarded as unsafe ( 18). In Uganda, the \nconstruction of an overpass for pedestrians on a \nmajor highway in Kampala had little effect either \non pedestrian road behaviour or on the incidence \nof crashes and injuries because of its inappropriate \nlocation ( 19).\nTrip reduction measures\nIt has been estimated from studies in high-income \ncountries that, under certain conditions, for each \n1% reduction in motor vehicle distance travelled, \nthere is a corresponding 1.4–1.8% reduction in the \nincidence of crashes ( 20, 21 ). Measures that may \nreduce the distance travelled include:\n— making greater use of electronic means of \ncommunications as a substitute for deliver -\ning communications by road;\n— encouraging more people to work from \nhome, using e-mail to communicate with \ntheir workplace;\n— better management of commuter transport, \nand of transport to and from schools and \ncolleges;\n— better management of tourist transport;\n— bans on freight transport;\n— restrictions on vehicle parking and road use.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 133})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 4.  INTERVENTIONS  • 111\nEncouraging use of safer modes of travel\nWhether measured by the time spent travelling \nor by the number of trips, travel by bus and train \nis many times safer than any other mode of road \ntravel. Policies that stimulate the use of public trans -\nport, and its combination with walking and cycling, \nare thus to be encouraged. While the walking and \ncycling parts of journeys bear relatively high risks, \npedestrians and cyclists create less risk for other \nroad users than do motor vehicles ( 6). However, by \nimplementing known safety measures, it should be \npossible to achieve a growth in healthier forms of \ntravel, such as walking and cycling, and at the same \ntime reduce the incidence of deaths and injuries \namong pedestrians and cyclists. These are goals that \nare increasingly being adopted in national transport \npolicies in high-income countries ( 15).\n Strategies that may increase the use of public \ntransport include ( 6):\n— improved mass transit systems (including \nimprovements to routes covered and ticket -\ning procedures, shorter distances between \nstops, and greater comfort and safety of both \nthe vehicle and the waiting areas);\n— better coordination between different modes \nof travel (including the coordination of sched -\nules and the harmonization of tariff schemes);\n— secure shelters for bicycles;\n— allowing bicycles to be carried on board \ntrains, ferries and buses;\n— “park and ride” facilities, where users can \npark their cars near public transport stops;\n— improvements to taxi services;\n— higher fuel taxes and other pricing reforms \nthat discourage private car use in favour of \npublic transport.\n Financial incentives have proved successful in \nsome highly-motorized countries; for example, \nin the Netherlands, a free public transport pass for \nstudents has resulted in lower car use ( 22).\n In many low-income countries, however, public \ntransport services often operate without regulation \nand create unacceptable levels of risk, both for their \noccupants and for those outside the vehicle. These risks \narise from overloaded vehicles, long working hours of \ndrivers, speeding and other dangerous behaviour. All the same, an improved public transport system with \nproper regulation and enforcement, combined with \nnon-motorized transportation – cycling and walking \n– can play an important part in low-income and mid -\ndle-income countries as a response to the growing \ndemand for transport and accessibility.\n Despite the generally lower injury risks asso -\nciated with public transport, more research on \nthe effectiveness of public transport strategies in \nreducing the incidence of road trafﬁc injuries still \nneeds to be carried out.\nMinimizing exposure to high-risk scenarios\nRestricting access to different parts of the \nroad network\nPreventing pedestrians and cyclists from accessing \nmotorways and preventing motor vehicles from \nentering pedestrian zones are two well-established \nmeasures for minimizing contact between high-\nspeed trafﬁc and unprotected road users. Because \nvehicles are physically prevented from entering \nthem, pedestrian zones are safer for travel on foot and \nalso – where there is shared use – for bicycle travel. \nMotorways have the lowest crash rates, in terms of \ndistance travelled, of the whole road network, by vir -\ntue of their sole use by motor vehicles, and their use \nof clear separation of trafﬁc and segregated junctions.\nGiving priority in the road network to higher \noccupancy vehicles\nGiving vehicles with many occupants priority in \ntrafﬁc over those with few occupants is a means \nof reducing the overall distance travelled by private \nmotorized transport – and hence of cutting down on \nexposure to risk. This strategy is adopted by many \ncities worldwide. For example, the high-capacity \nbus system in the city of Curitibá, Brazil, provides \nsegregated bus lanes, priority at trafﬁc lights for \nbuses, as well as safe and fast access for users ( 23).\nRestrictions on speed and engine performance \nof motorized two-wheelers\nMany high-income countries have introduced \nregulations relating to speed and engine perform -\nance for mopeds and motorcycles, with the aim of \nreducing rates of crashes and injury ( 24).')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 134})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '112 •  WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\n Restricting the engine capacity for beginner \nmotorcyclists has proved to be a successful interven -\ntion. In the United Kingdom in the early 1980s, for \ninstance, the maximum engine size of a motorcycle \nthat learners could ride was reduced from 250 cc \nto 125 cc; this was accompanied by a limitation on \nthe maximum power output (to 9 kW). As a result, \nmany inexperienced motorcyclists transferred to \nless powerful vehicles, leading to an estimated 25% \nreduction in casualties among young motorcyclists \n(25). A later study found a signiﬁcantly greater crash \nrisk associated with larger motorcycles, despite the \nfact that these machines were ridden mostly by \nmore experienced riders ( 25).\n Japan is one country that imposes limits, for \nsafety reasons, on the engine size and perform -\nance of large motorcycles used domestically, though \nsimilar controls do not apply to exports of new \nmotorcycles from Japan to other countries ( 26). In \nthe case of these exported motorcycles, outputs of \n75–90 brake horse power (56–67 kW) – or even 130 \nbrake horse power (97 kW) – are quite common \nnow, with top speeds reaching almost 200 miles/h \n(322 km/h) ( 27).Increasing the legal age for use of motorized \ntwo-wheelers\nIn Malaysia, out of a number of proposed measures \nto reduce motorcycle crashes, increasing the legal \nriding age from 16 to 18 years was found to have \nthe greatest cost–beneﬁt. Preventing young riders \nfrom riding at night was also considered. Although \nthis measure also produced a positive net beneﬁt, \nthe magnitude of the saving was small, since most \ncrashes occurred during daytime ( 28).\nGraduated driver licensing systems\nThe high risks faced by young drivers and motorized \ntwo-wheeler riders in their ﬁrst months of driving \nhave already been discussed (see Chapter 3). For \nyoung car drivers, the two principal risks are night-\ntime driving and transporting young passengers \n(29). In response, graduated driver licensing systems \nwere ﬁrst introduced in New Zealand in 1987 , and \nare now widely implemented in Canada, the United \nStates and some other places. These schemes provide \ngradual access to a full driving licence for novice \ndrivers and riders ( 30) (see Box 4.1).\nBOX 4.1\nGraduated driver licensing systems\nBeginner drivers of all ages lack both driving skills and experience in recognizing potential dangers. For newly-licensed \nteenage drivers, their immaturity and limited driving experience result in disproportionately high rates of crashes. \nGraduated driver licensing systems address the high risks faced by new drivers by requiring an apprenticeship of planned \nand supervised practice – the learner’s permit stage. This is then followed by a provisional licence that places temporary \nrestrictions on unsupervised driving ( 31). Commonly imposed restrictions include limits on night-time driving, limits on \nthe number of passengers, and a prohibition against driving after drinking any alcohol. These restrictions are lifted as \nnew drivers gain experience and teenage drivers mature, gaining a full licence ( 32). Although the speciﬁc requirements \nfor advancing through these three stages – the learner’s permit, the provisional licence and the full licence – vary \naccording to country, they provide a protective environment while new drivers become more experienced ( 33).\n Graduated driver licensing schemes have consistently proved effective in reducing crash risks for new drivers. \nPeer-reviewed evaluations of the effectiveness of such schemes in Canada, New Zealand and the United States have \nreported reductions in crashes involving new drivers in the range of 9–43% ( 34–36 ). Why such reductions should exist \nhas not yet been deﬁnitively established. It is generally accepted, though, that the safety beneﬁts of schemes result \nboth from decreases in the amount of driving by inexperienced drivers and from improvements in their driving skills \nunder conditions of low risk.\n The elevated risk of a crash for beginner drivers is universal, and graduated driver licensing can effectively reduce \nthis risk. It can apply to all newly-licensed drivers, not just those who are young. Research has clearly demonstrated \nthat older beginner drivers experience higher crash rates than drivers of the same age with several years of \nexperience. For this reason, Canada, where many new drivers are not young, applies graduated driver licensing to \nall beginners, regardless of their age. Even countries where the legal age for driving is higher than the average can \nbeneﬁt from the introduction of graduated driver licensing.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 135})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 4.  INTERVENTIONS  • 113\n The reduction in the incidence of crashes resulting \nfrom the introduction of these systems varies from \n4% to over 60%. This large range may in part be \nexplained by methodological differences, differences \nin the restrictions used and the degree to which they \nare enforced ( 35). The major reductions would seem \nto arise from more supervised driving and from a \nhigh degree of compliance with restrictions ( 37). It \nis not as yet clear, though, which of the many restric -\ntions – including limits on the number of passengers \ncarried, use of seat-belts, lower blood alcohol concen -\ntration (BAC) limits and night-time driving bans – is \nthe most cost-effective ( 35). Graduated driver licens -\ning schemes have generally been well accepted ( 29).\n The New Zealand scheme is made up of three \nstages, and all new drivers aged 15–24 years have \nto take part. The ﬁrst stage is a six-month super -\nvised learner driver permit, which is obtained by \npassing a written test, an oral theory test and an \neyesight test. The restricted licence stage lasts for \n18 months and is completed by passing a practical \ndriving test. There are bans during both the ﬁrst \ntwo stages on night-time driving (from 22:00 to \n05:00) and on carrying passengers under the age of \n20 years (unless the driving is supervised), as well \nas a BAC limit of 0.03 g/dl. Violations of these con -\nditions can result in the licence restrictions being \nextended by a further six months. An evaluation of \nthe scheme found that it had led to an 8% reduc -\ntion in crashes involving serious injury, and that \nthe restrictions, particularly the night-time driving \nban, had made a signiﬁcant contribution ( 36).\n Another version of a graduated licensing sys -\ntem, introduced in Austria in 1993, resulted in \nthe incidence of crashes being reduced by more \nthan a third ( 22). There was a probation period \nof two years for novice drivers and a BAC limit of \n0.01 g/dl. If, during this period, there were any \noffences involving excess alcohol or driving that \nled to injury or death, a two-year extended proba -\ntion was imposed, as well as obligatory attendance \nat a driver improvement programme.\nShaping the road network for road \ninjury prevention\nRoad safety considerations are central to the planning, design and operation of the road network. By \nadjusting the design of the road and road networks \nto accommodate human characteristics and to be \nmore “forgiving” if an error is made, road safety \nengineering strategies can make a major contribu -\ntion to road injury prevention and mitigation ( 10).\nSafety-awareness in planning road  \nnetworks\nThe framework for the systemic management of \nroad safety in high-income countries is increasingly \ndeﬁned by the following activities ( 10, 38–40 ):\n— classifying the road network according to \ntheir primary road functions;\n— setting appropriate speed limits according to \nthose road functions;\n— improving road layout and design to encour -\nage better use.\n These approaches can, in principle, be adapted \nto the contexts of middle-income and low-income \ncountries. Within these general principles, safety \nengineering and trafﬁc management should aim:\n— to prevent road use that does not match the \nfunctions for which the road was designed;\n— to manage the trafﬁc mix by separating dif -\nferent kinds of road users, so as to eliminate \nconﬂicting movements of road users, except \nat low speeds;\n— to prevent uncertainty among road users \nabout appropriate road use.\n A large body of knowledge exists to support the \nuse of a safety-awareness approach to road planning \nand is available in the form of design standards and \nbest practice guidelines and manuals. Examples \ninclude the requirements for the development of \n“sustainable safety” in road networks in the Nether -\nlands ( 41) and an earlier set of guidelines for achiev -\ning safer roads in developing countries ( 10).\nClassifying roads and setting speed limits by \ntheir function\nMany roads have a range of functions, and are used \nby different types of vehicles and by pedestrians \n– with large differences in speed, mass of vehi -\ncle and degree of protection.

"('page_content', '114 •  WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nBOX 4.2\nRoad types and appropriate speeds\nThe Dutch policy of sustainable safety divides roads into one of three types according to their function, and then sets \nspeed limits accordingly ( 41):\n• Flow roads  (or through-roads). For such roads, through-trafﬁc goes from the place of departure to the destination \nwithout interruption. Speeds above 100–120 km/h are not permitted, and there is a complete separation of trafﬁc \nstreams.\n• Distributor roads . These roads enable users to enter or leave an area. The needs of moving trafﬁc continue to be \npredominant. Local distributor roads carry trafﬁc to and from large urban districts, villages and rural areas, and \nhave trafﬁc interchanges at limited sections. These roads give equal importance to motorized and non-motorized \nlocal trafﬁc, but separate users wherever possible. Speeds on distributor roads should not exceed 50 km/h within \nbuilt-up areas or 80 km/h outside such areas. There should be separate paths for pedestrians and cyclists, dual \ncarriageways with separation of streams along the full length, speed controls at major crossings, and right of way.\n• Residential access roads . These roads are typically used to reach a dwelling, shop or business. The needs of non-\nmotorized users are predominant. There is a constant access and interchange of trafﬁc and the vast majority of \nroads are of this type. For residential access roads in towns and villages, speeds above 30 km/h are not permitted. In \nrural areas, no speeds over 40 km/h are allowed at crossings and entries – otherwise 60 km/h may be acceptable.\nWhere a road performs a mixture of functions, the appropriate speed is normally the lowest of the speeds \nappropriate to the individual functions.between the mobility of motor vehicle users on the \none hand and the safety of pedestrians and cyclists \non the other. Most pedestrian crashes occur within \none mile (1.6 km) of the victim’s home or place of \nbusiness ( 15, 42 ).\n Classifying roads functionally – in the form \nof a “road hierarchy”, as it is known in highway \nengineering – is important for providing safer \nroutes and safer designs. Such a classiﬁcation takes \naccount of land use, location of crash sites, vehicle \nand pedestrian ﬂows, and objectives such as speed \ncontrol.\n The Dutch “sustainable safety” policy sets dif -\nferent speed limits according to the road function \n(see Box 4.2), together with a range of operational \nrequirements ( 41). A study found that, by adopt -\ning these principles, a reduction of more than one \nthird in the average number of injury crashes per \nmillion vehicle-kilometres – driven on all types \nof roads in the Netherlands – could be achieved \n(43).\n Research is needed so that these principles can \nbe adopted more widely, and particularly to work \nout how to adapt and apply them in the speciﬁc \ncontexts of low-income countries.Incorporating safety features into road design\nA key objective of safety engineering is to make driv -\ners naturally choose to comply with the speed limit. \nThrough the use of self-explanatory road layouts, \nengineering can lead to safer road user behaviour, as \nwell as correcting defects in road design that other -\nwise may lead to crashes. The following description \nof different types of roads illustrates the relationship \nbetween road function, road speed and road design.\nHigher-speed roads\nHigher-speed roads include motorways, expressways \nand multi-lane, divided highways with limited access. \nThey are designed to allow for higher speeds by pro -\nviding large-radius horizontal and vertical curves, \n“forgiving” roadsides, entry and exit “grade-sepa -\nrated” junctions – where there is no contact between \nmotorized and non-motorized trafﬁc – and median \nbarriers to separate opposing directions of trafﬁc. \nSuch roads have the lowest rates of road injury in \nterms of distance travelled because of these design \nfeatures and the fact that non-motorized users are \nprohibited ( 39). In low-income countries, it is also \nnecessary to separate motorized two-wheelers from \ncar and truck trafﬁc travelling in the same direction.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 137})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 4.  INTERVENTIONS  • 115\nSingle-lane carriageways\nSingle-lane carriageways in rural areas include many \ndifferent types of road. The numbers and rates of casu -\nalties are much higher than on motorways, because \nof the large differences in speed between the various \ntypes of user. Crashes on local rural roads arise most \ncommonly from vehicles leaving the road through loss \nof control as a result of inappropriate speed ( 44). Apart \nfrom speed limits, a range of engineering measures is \nneeded to encourage appropriate speed and make haz -\nards easily perceptible. These measures include:\n— provision for slow-moving trafﬁc and for \nvulnerable road users;\n— lanes for overtaking, as well as lanes for \nvehicles waiting to turn across the path of \noncoming trafﬁc;\n— median barriers to prevent overtaking and to \neliminate head-on crashes;\n— better highlighting of hazards through road \nlighting at junctions and roundabouts;\n— improved vertical alignment;\n— advisory speed limits at sharp bends;\n— regular speed-limit signs;— rumble strips;\n— the systematic removal of roadside hazards – such \nas trees, utility poles and other solid objects.\n Much best practice in this area has been identi -\nﬁed in high-income countries ( 45).\n A particular speed management problem is how \nto handle the transition from high-speed roads to \nlower-speed roads – for instance, when a vehicle \nleaves a motorway, or when it enters a winding \nstretch of narrow road after a long, straight stretch \nof road. The creation of transition zones on busy \nroads approaching towns and villages can reduce \ncrashes and injuries for all types of road user. \nDesign features that use a “gateway”, or threshold, \ncan inﬂuence drivers progressively to reduce their \nspeed, and signal the beginning of the speed limit \nfor commercial and residential areas. In approaches \nto slower-speed zones, rumble strips, speed humps, \nvisual warnings in the pavement, and roundabouts \nhave all been found useful in slowing the speed of \nvehicles ( 45). In Ghana, the introduction of rumble \nstrips reduced crashes by some 35% and deaths by \n55% in certain locations ( 46) (see Box 4.3).\nBOX 4.3\nSpeed bumps in Ghana: a low-cost road safety intervention\nRoad safety is a serious problem in Ghana, where fatality rates are some 30 to 40 times greater than those in \nindustrialized countries. The excessive vehicle speeds that prevail on the country’s inter-urban highways and on roads \nin built-up areas have been shown to be a key contributory factor in serious trafﬁc crashes ( 46).\n In recent years, speed bumps have been installed at some crash-prone locations on the highways, so as to lower the \nspeed of vehicles and improve the trafﬁc environment for other road users, including pedestrians and cyclists, in built-\nup areas. These speed bumps produce discomfort when vehicles pass over them at higher speeds; with their vehicles \nlifted off the ground and with the resulting noise, drivers are forced to reduce their speed. This in turn decreases the \nkinetic energy of the vehicle that can cause injuries and deaths on impact, and gives drivers longer warning of possible \ncollisions, lessening the likelihood of road crashes.\n The use of speed bumps, in the form of rumble strips and speed humps, has been found to be effective on Ghanaian \nroads. For instance, rumble strips on the main Accra–Kumasi highway at the crash hot spot of Suhum Junction reduced \nthe number of trafﬁc crashes by around 35%. Fatalities fell by some 55% and serious injuries by 76%, between January \n2000 and April 2001. This speed-reducing measure succeeded in reducing or even eliminating certain kinds of crashes \nas well as improving the safety of pedestrians ( 46).\n Speed control bumps and humps have now become increasingly common on Ghanaian roads, particularly in built-\nup areas where excessive vehicle speeds threaten other road users. A wide range of materials – including vulcanized \nrubber, hot thermoplastic materials, bituminous mixes, concrete and bricks – have been used in the construction of the \nspeed control areas.\n Rumble strips are cheap and easy to install. They have been constructed at potentially dangerous places on the \nCape Coast–Takoradi highway, the Bunso–Koforidua highway and the Tema–Akosombo highway. Speed humps, on \nthe other hand, have been laid to slow down vehicles and improve the safety of pedestrians in the towns of Ejisu and \nBesease on the Accra–Kumasi highway.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 138})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '116 •  WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nResidential access roads\nResidential access roads are often designed to achieve \nvery low speeds. Speed limits, usually supported \nby physical self-enforcing measures to encourage \ncompliance, are normally around 30 km/h, though \nlower limits are often prescribed.\nArea-wide urban safety management\nEngineering measures applied on an area-wide \nbasis in towns and cities create safer conditions \nfor pedestrians and cyclists, as well as avoiding the \ndisplacement of trafﬁc which could lead to crashes \nelsewhere. Research is urgently needed in develop -\ning countries into area-wide urban safety manage -\nment relating to motorized two-wheelers.\n The principal road safety engineering tech -\nniques for improving the safety of pedestrians and \ncyclists are the provision of safer routes – through \nsegregation and separation – and area-wide speed \nreduction or trafﬁc-calming measures ( 22, 23 ). \nThese are discussed below.\nSafer routes for pedestrians and cyclists. The \ncreation of networks of connected and convenient \npedestrian and cyclist routes, together with the \nprovision of public transport, can lead to greater \nsafety for vulnerable road users ( 47). The routes \nwill typically consist of footpaths or cycle paths \nseparate from any carriageway, pedestrian-only \nareas with or without cyclists being admitted, \nfootpaths or cycle tracks alongside carriageways, \nand carriageways or other surfaces shared with \nmotor vehicles. Where pedestrian or cycle routes \ncross signiﬁcant ﬂows of motor vehicle trafﬁc, the \nlocation and design of the crossing point needs \nspecial attention. Where routes are not separated \nfrom carriageways, or where space is shared with \nmotor vehicles, the physical layout will need to \nmanage speeds ( 15).\n Pedestrian footpaths and pavements are used \nmore in high-income than in low-income coun -\ntries and tend to be in urban rather than rural \nareas. The risk of a crash on roads without pave -\nments separating pedestrians from motorized \ntrafﬁc is twice that on a road with a pavement \n(48). Pavements in poor condition or obstructed by parked vehicles may force pedestrians to walk \non the street, thus signiﬁcantly increasing crash \nrisk. This danger is particularly great for people \ncarrying heavy loads, pushing prams, or who \nhave difﬁculty in walking. Studies in low-income \nand middle-income countries have shown that \neven where pavements exist, they are often \nblocked – for instance, by street vendors’ stalls \n(18, 49 ).\n Providing pavements for pedestrians is a \nproven safety measure, which also helps the ﬂow \nof motorized trafﬁc. Bicycle paths have also been \nshown to be effective in reducing crashes, particu -\nlarly at junctions ( 22). Danish studies have found \nreductions of 35% in cyclist casualties on particular \nroutes, following the construction of cycle tracks \nor lanes alongside urban roads ( 50).\nTrafﬁc-calming measures. At speeds below \n30 km/h pedestrians can coexist with motor vehi -\ncles in relative safety. Speed management and traf -\nﬁc-calming include techniques such as discouraging \ntrafﬁc from entering certain areas and installing \nphysical speed-reducing measures, such as rounda -\nbouts, road narrowings, chicanes and road humps. \nThese measures are often backed up by speed limits \nof 30 km/h, but they can be designed to achieve \nvarious levels of appropriate speed.\n In Europe, there has been much experimenta -\ntion with these measures and crash reductions of \nbetween 15% and 80% have been achieved ( 44, \n51–54 ). In the town of Baden, Austria, about 75% \nof the road network is now part of a 30 km/h \nzone, or else a residential street with an even \nlower speed limit. Since integrated transport and \na wide-ranging safety plan were introduced in \n1988, the town has seen a 60% reduction in road \ncasualties ( 55).\n Most of the principles incorporated into design \nguidelines for trafﬁc calming in high-income \ncountries also apply to low-income countries, \nthough in practice the guidelines will need to be \nmodiﬁed because of the much higher proportion \nof non-motorized trafﬁc ( 23). As Table 4.1, which \nsummarizes the effects of measures undertaken in \na British town, shows, area-wide speed and trafﬁc ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 139})","('type', 'Document')"

No similar studies \nfrom low-income or middle-income countries \nwere found ( 57).\nSafety audits\nWhen new transport projects are proposed, area-\nwide safety impact assessments are needed to \nensure the proposals do not have an adverse safety \nimpact on the surrounding network. Road safety \naudits are then required to check that the pro -\nposed design and implementation are consistent \nwith safety principles, and to examine whether \nfurther design changes are needed to prevent \ncrashes ( 12).\n The safety audit procedure is usually carried out \nat various stages of a new project, including:\n— the feasibility study of the project;\n— the draft design;\n— the detailed design;\n— before the project becomes operational;\n— a few months after the project is operational.\n An essential element of the audit process is \nthat it should be carried out separately by both an \nindependent design team, and a team with experi -\nence and expertise in road safety engineering and crash investigation. Guidelines \nfor safety audits have been devel -\noped in many parts of the world, \nincluding Malaysia ( 58–60 ).\n Formal safety audit procedures \nhave been shown to be effec -\ntive and cost-effective ways \nof improving road safety and \nreducing the long-term costs \nassociated with a new road \nscheme ( 39). Mandatory safety \naudit procedures have existed in \na number of countries including \nAustralia, Denmark, New Zea -\nland and the United Kingdom \nfor several years ( 61). In New Zealand, it has been \nestimated that the procedures carry a cost–beneﬁt \nratio of 1:20 ( 62). A Danish study assessed the \nvalue in cost–beneﬁt terms of 13 schemes and \nfound ﬁrst year rates of return of well over 100% \n(63).\nCrash-protective roadsides\nCollisions between vehicles leaving the road and \nroadside objects including trees, poles and road \nsigns, often of very high mass, are a major road \nsafety problem worldwide. Research that built on \nwork by the Organisation for Economic Co-opera -\ntion and Development in 1975 ( 64) suggests that \nexisting strategies to tackle the problem of roadside \nobjects would be strengthened by ( 65):\n— designing roads without dangerous roadside \nobjects;\n— introducing a clear zone at the side of the \nroad;\n— designing roadside objects so that they are \nmore “forgiving”;\n— protecting roadside objects with barriers to \nabsorb part of the impact energy;\n— protecting vehicle occupants from the \nconsequences of collisions with roadside \nobjects, through better vehicle design.\n Collapsible lighting columns and other devices \nthat break away on impact were ﬁrst introduced in \nthe United States in the 1970s and are now used \nwidely throughout the world.

Early research conducted in the \nUnited States indicated that break-away columns \ncould result in reductions in injuries of around \n30% ( 66).\n Safety barriers are frequently used to separate \ntrafﬁc or to prevent it from leaving the road. They \nare designed to deﬂect or contain the striking vehi -\ncle while ensuring that the forces involved do not \nresult in serious injury to occupants of the vehicle. \nIf properly installed and in the appropriate places, \nsafety barriers can be effective in reducing the \nincidence of crashes, their severity and their con -\nsequences ( 67). Crash research has highlighted the \nneed for more effective linkages between vehicle \nprotection standards and standards for safety bar -\nriers, which take into account the range of vehicles \n– from small cars to heavy trucks – that are likely \nto make use of them.\n Guard fences and rails are situated at the edge of \nthe carriageway to deﬂect or contain vehicles, or \nin the central reserve where their aim is to reduce \ncrashes involving vehicles crossing into approach -\ning trafﬁc. The fences and rails can be rigid (made \nof concrete), semi-rigid (made from steel beams \nor box beams) or ﬂexible (made from cable or \nwire). Cable barriers have been used cost-effec -\ntively in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and the \nUnited Kingdom ( 65). Central cable rails are being \ninstalled to an increasing degree in Sweden to pre -\nvent dangerous overtaking on single-carriageway \nroads. On two-lane roads with grade-separated \ncrossings, the use of central cable rails has pro -\nduced estimated reductions of 45–50% in fatal and \nserious casualties ( 68).\nCrash cushions\nCrash cushions are very effective in reducing the \nconsequences of a crash by cushioning the vehi -\ncle before it strikes rigid roadside hazards, such \nas bridge piers, barrier terminals, light posts and \nsign supports. Evaluations in the United States of \ncrash cushion installations have found a reduc -tion in fatal and serious injuries at crash sites of \nup to 75% ( 66). In Birmingham, England, install -\ning crash cushions resulted in a 40% reduction in \ninjury crashes, and a reduction (from 67% to 14%) \nin the number of fatal and serious crashes at the \ntreated sites ( 69).\nRemedial action at high-risk crash sites\nThe systematic implementation of low-cost road \nand trafﬁc engineering measures is a highly cost-\neffective method of creating safer patterns of road \nuse and correcting faults in the planning and design \nof the roads that have led to trafﬁc crashes. The use \nof road safety audits and safety impact assessments \ncan prevent such faults from being introduced into \nnew or modiﬁed roads ( 12).\n Low-cost road and trafﬁc engineering measures \nconsist of physical measures taken speciﬁcally to \nenhance the safety of the road system. Ideally, \nthey are cheap, can be implemented quickly, and \nare highly cost-effective (see Table 4.2). Examples \ninclude:\n— physical changes to roads to make them safer \n(e.g. the introduction of skid-resistant sur -\nfacing);\n— the installation of central refuges and \nislands;\n— improved lighting, signs and markings;\n— changes in the operation of junctions, for \nexample, by installing small roundabouts, \nchanging the signal control or improving \nsigns and markings.\nSuch measures can be applied at:\n— high-risk sites, for instance, a particular \nbend or junction;\n— along a section of route where the risk is \ngreater than average, though the measures \nare not necessarily concentrated at speciﬁc \nsites;\n— over a whole neighbourhood.\n Experience has shown that for high beneﬁts \nto be achieved relative to costs, a systematic and \nmultidisciplinary approach to identify sites, to \nimplement low-cost road and trafﬁc engineering \nmeasures, and to evaluate outcomes is required, as \nwell as an efﬁcient organizational framework ( 71).

Some countries – including Austria, Canada, \nHungary, the Nordic countries and some states in the \nUnited States – now require by law varying levels of \nuse of daytime running lights ( 16). This may involve \neither drivers switching on their headlamps or the \nﬁtting of switches or special lamps on vehicles.\n Two meta-analyses of the effects of daytime \nrunning lights on cars show that the measure con -\ntributes substantially to reducing road crashes. The \nﬁrst study, which examined daytime crashes involv -\ning more than one party, found a reduction in the \nnumber of crashes of around 13% with the use of \ndaytime lights, and reduction of between 8% and \n15% as a result of introducing mandatory laws on \ndaytime use ( 16). The number of pedestrians and \ncyclists hit by cars was reduced by 15% and 10%, \nrespectively. The second study found a reduction of \nslightly over 12% in daytime crashes involving more \nthan one party, a 20% decrease in injured victims \nand a 25% reduction in deaths in such crashes ( 72). \nA study of data over four years from nine American states concluded that, on average, cars ﬁtted with \nautomatic daytime running lights were involved in \n3.2% fewer multiple crashes than vehicles without \n(73). Following the introduction of daytime running \nlights and the enforcement of their use in Hungary, \nthere has been a 13% reduction in the number of \nfrontal crashes in daylight ( 74).\n A cost–beneﬁt analysis of providing automatic \nlight switches on cars for daytime running lamps \nusing standard low-beam headlights found that the \nbeneﬁts outweighed the costs by a factor of 4.4. The \nﬁtting of daytime running lights with special lamps \nwith economical bulbs increased the cost–beneﬁt to \na factor of 6.4 ( 75). Motorized two-wheeler users \nhave expressed concerns that daytime running \nlights on cars could reduce the visibility of motor -\ncyclists.

For cyclists, front, rear and wheel reﬂectors, \nand bicycle lamps that are visible at speciﬁed dis -\ntances, are often required in high-income coun -\ntries. The quality and use of lights can be improved \nby enabling the storage of separate light systems or \nby designing the lighting into the cycle frame ( 15).\n Safety researchers in low-income countries have \nsuggested various means for improving the visibility \nof vulnerable road users. The use of retro-reﬂective \nvests, common in high-income countries, may be \nproblematic owing to their cost and the discomfort in \nwearing them in hot climates. A design for a brightly-\ncoloured orange or yellow shopping bag that can \nquickly be transformed into a conspicuous vest has \nbeen proposed for two-wheeler users in low-income \ncountries ( 79). Encouraging the use of colours such \nas orange and yellow for bicycles, for wheels, and for \nthe rear ends of rickshaws and other non-motorized \nvehicles, has also been suggested ( 23). Many countries require the ﬁtting of reﬂectors \non the front and rear of non-motorized vehicles. \nIn low-income countries, though, rules could be \nextended to cover all animal carts, cycle trishaws \nand other forms of local transport that currently \ncreate road safety risks because of their poor vis -\nibility at night. The use of reﬂectors on the sides of \nvehicles may be helpful at junctions ( 23). However, \nwhile all these aids to visibility would appear to \nhave great potential, their actual effectiveness in \nincreasing the safety of pedestrians and cyclists \nremains largely unknown and requires additional \nstudy ( 80).\nCrash-protective vehicle design\nWhile market forces can help advance in-car safety \nin individual car models, the aim of harmonizing \nlegislative standards of vehicle design is to ensure \na uniform and acceptable level of safety across a \nwhole product line.\n Legislative standards are produced by differ -\nent authorities, from the national to international \nlevel. On a global scale, these include the United \nNations Economic Commission for Europe, and \non a regional level, groupings such as the Euro -\npean Union. Standardization at the regional and \nnational levels, taking into account as it does local \nconditions, can often produce faster action than \na similar process at the international level. High-\nincome countries routinely set out their national \npriorities in reports to the International Technical \nConferences on the Enhanced Safety of Vehicles. \nPriorities in some low-income and middle-\nincome countries have also been identiﬁed ( 23, \n81–83 ).\n A study in the United Kingdom concluded that \nimproved vehicle crash protection (also known \nas “secondary safety” or “passive safety”) for car \noccupants and pedestrians would have the greatest \neffect, out of all new policies under consideration, in \nreducing road casualties in Great Britain (see Table \n4.3) ( 84). Comparable analyses in New Zealand esti -\nmated that improvements being made in the safety \nof the vehicle ﬂeet would reduce projected social \ncosts in 2010 by just under 16% ( 85).\n ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 143})","('type', 'Document')"

A review of the effectiveness of casualty reduction measures in the United Kingdom between 1980 \nand 1996 found that the greatest contribution to reducing casualties was secondary safety or crash protection \nimprovements to vehicles. These accounted for around 15% of the reduction, compared with 11% for drink-drive \nmeasures and 6.5% for road safety engineering measures ( 84).\n Another review, by the European Transport Safety Council, estimated that improved standards for crash \nprotection could reduce deaths and serious injuries on European roads by as much as 20% ( 86). Analysis has shown \nthat if all cars were designed to provide impact protection equivalent to that of the best cars in the same class, half \nof all fatal and disabling injuries could be avoided ( 87).\n During the 1990s, signiﬁcant steps towards improved protection of occupants of cars were made in the highly-\nmotorized countries. In the European Union, there were several directives on frontal and side impact protection, and \ninformation on crash tests from the European New Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP) was widely disseminated. \nMuch of the research and development necessary for improvements in other safety areas for car occupants – such as \nsmart seat-belt reminders – has been completed and now requires legislation to bring it into force.\n Globally, the predominant category of road casualties up to 2020 will continue to be vulnerable road users. \nProtection for those outside the vehicle against impact is thus a priority in the ﬁeld of vehicle design.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 144})","('type', 'Document')"

Between 1988 \nand 1994, an EEVC working group on pedestrian \nprotection developed a complete series of test \nmethods to evaluate the front of passenger cars \nwith respect to pedestrian safety ( 92), and these \ntest methods were further improved in 1998 ( 95). \nThe tests assume an impact speed of 40 km/h and \nconsist of the following:\n— a bumper test to prevent serious knee-joint \ninjuries and leg fractures;\n— a bonnet leading-edge test to prevent femur \nand hip fractures in adults and head injuries \nin children;\n— two tests involving the bonnet top to prevent \nlife-threatening head injuries.\n It has been estimated that take up of these tests \ncould avoid 20% of deaths and serious injuries to \npedestrians and cyclists in European Union coun -\ntries annually ( 87, 94, 96 ). \n These tests, with minor amendments have \nbeen used by the European New Car Assessment \nProgramme since 1997, and more recently by the \nAustralian New Car Assessment Programme. Of the \nmany new cars tested to date, only one type of car \nhas shown evidence of having reasonable protec -\ntion – about 80% of the protection demanded by \nthe tests at an estimated additional manufacturing \ncost for new designs of €10 per car ( 97). Studies \ncarried out by national road safety research organi -\nzations in Europe have shown that the beneﬁts of \nadopting the four EEVC tests would outweigh the \ncosts ( 98).\n Legislation in this area is expected shortly in \nseveral countries, but the contents of the legislation \nare the subject of continuing international discus -\nsions ( 87, 99 ). Experts believe that the adoption of \nthe well-researched EEVC tests would save many lives ( 82, 93, 100 ) – perhaps as many as 2000 lives \nannually in the European Union alone ( 87).\nSafer bus and truck fronts\nExtending the crash-protective vehicle exterior \nconcept to vans, pick-up trucks and other trucks, \nand buses is an urgent requirement for protecting \nvulnerable road users in low-income countries ( 82, \n88, 101 ). Buses and trucks are involved in a greater \nproportion of crashes in low-income countries than \nthey are in high-income countries ( 102). Prelimi -\nnary investigations have suggested that signiﬁcant \nreductions in injuries could be achieved if the geom -\netry and design of truck fronts were changed ( 102). \nThe critical geometric features that inﬂuence injury \nand that continue to require attention by truck \ndesigners have been set out ( 101). Given the growth \nof megacities such as Bangkok, Beijing, Mexico City, \nSão Paulo, Shanghai and others, the protection of \nvulnerable road users from bus and truck fronts take \non particular importance. Many such cities have \nunique vehicles, such as the tuk-tuk  of Bangkok, the \nbecak of Jakarta and the three-wheeled taxis of India. \nSuch vehicles incorporate almost no concept of crash \nprotection, for either pedestrians or occupants. They \npresent a good opportunity, therefore, for technical \nknowledge to improve their safety to be transferred \nfrom western car designers ( 23).\nCar occupant protection\nThe essential aims in crash protection are:\n— to maintain, through appropriate design, \nthe integrity of the car’s passenger compart -\nment;\n— to provide protection against elements that \ncould cause injury in the car’s interior;\n— to ensure that vehicle occupants are appro -\npriately restrained;\n— to reduce the probability of an occupant \nbeing ejected;\n— to prevent injury to other occupants (in a \nfrontal crash, unbelted rear-seat occupants \ncan cause injury to belted occupants seated \nin front of them);\n— to improve the compatibility between vehi -\ncles of different mass (e.g. between car and ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 145})","('type', 'Document')"

Such standards offering a \nminimum, but high level of protection need to be \nadopted in all countries.\nFrontal and side impact protection. The vast \nmajority of car crashes in high-income countries \nare offset frontal crashes (where only one side \nof a vehicle’s front end hits the other vehicle or \nobject). In the United States, for example, 79% of \ninjuries from frontal crashes occur as a result of \noffset frontal crashes ( 81). A recent priority for \nsafety engineers working on frontal impact pro -\ntection has been to improve the car structure so it \ncan endure severe offset impacts with little or no \nintrusion of external objects. This allows space, in \nthe event of a crash, for the seat-belts and air bags \nto slow down the occupants with the minimum \nrisk of injury.\n In most high-income countries, there are \nlegislative performance requirements for cars to \nundergo a full-width frontal barrier test or an off -\nset deformable barrier test. The former is acknowl -\nedged as an appropriate method for testing occu -\npant restraint systems in frontal crashes. The latter, \nthe offset deformable barrier test, is a more realistic \nsimulation of what happens to a car’s structure in \na typical injury-producing frontal crash. The use \nof both tests is therefore important to ensure crash \nprotection for car occupants ( 83, 103 ). Both tests \nare appropriate for more types of vehicle than they \nare currently used for.\n Side impacts, while less frequent than frontal \ncrashes, typically cause more severe injuries. In side \nimpacts, it is difﬁcult to prevent occupants on the \nside that is struck from coming into contact with \nthe car’s interior. Attempts at greater protection \nthus rely on managing the problem of intrusion, \nand providing padding and side air bags. During \nthe 1990s, legislative standards were introduced in most high-income countries to offer better protec -\ntion in side impacts. Following the experiences and \nevaluation of these requirements for frontal and \nside impact protection in Europe, various improve -\nments have since been identiﬁed ( 83, 104 ).\n As mentioned earlier, advanced crash tests, car -\nried out for the beneﬁt of consumer information \nby various New Car Assessment Programmes and \nby organizations such as the Insurance Institute for \nHighway Safety in the United States, play a vital \nrole in promoting car design that provides good \nfrontal and side impact protection.\nOccupant restraints. The use of seat-belts con -\ntinues to be the most important form of occupant \nrestraint. Measures to increase their use – by \nmeans of legislation, information, enforcement \nand smart audible seat-belt reminders – are \ncentral to improving the safety of car occupants. \nWhen used, seat-belts have been found to reduce \nthe risk of serious and fatal injury by between \n40% and 65%. The ﬁtting of anchorages and seat-\nbelts are covered by various technical standards \nworldwide and in most countries these standards \nare mandatory for cars. However, there is anec -\ndotal evidence that a half or more of all vehicles \nin low-income countries may lack functioning \nseat-belts ( 17).\n Air bags are being increasingly provided in cars \nas an extra means of restraint, in addition to three-\npoint seat-belts. They should be ﬁtted universally \nto increase the protection of occupants involved in \ncrashes. While driver and front-seat passenger air \nbags do not offer protection in all types of impact \nand do not diminish the risk of ejection ( 105), \nwhen combined with seat-belt use, they have been \nfound to reduce the risk of death in frontal crashes \nby 68% ( 106). Estimates of the general effectiveness \nof air bags in reducing deaths in all types of crashes \nrange from 8% to 14% ( 106–108 ). Where passenger \nair bags are ﬁtted, however, clear instructions are \nneeded to avoid ﬁtting rear-facing child restraints \non the same seat. Also required are devices to auto -\nmatically detect child restraints and out-of-posi -\ntion occupants, and in such cases to switch off the \npassenger air bag.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 146})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '124 •  WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nProtection against roadside objects. Collisions \nbetween cars and trees or poles are characterized \nby the severity of the injuries produced. Current \nlegislation only requires the use of crash tests with \nbarriers representing car-to-car impacts. It may \nnow be time to supplement these tests with front \nand side car-to-pole tests, as practised in some \nconsumer testing programmes. Better coordination \nis required between the design of cars and that of \nsafety barriers ( 65, 109 ).\nVehicle-to-vehicle compatibility\nAchieving vehicle-to-vehicle compatibility in crashes \ndepends upon the particular mix of motor vehicle. \nIn the United States, for example, there is a greater \nneed to reconcile sports utility vehicles and other \nlight truck vehicles with passenger cars. The United \nStates National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administra -\ntion has made vehicle compatibility one of its leading \npriorities and has published its proposed initiatives \nin a recent report ( 110). In Europe, work focuses \non trying to improve car-to-car compatibility for \nboth front-to-front and front-to-side crashes and \nrecommendations on this have been put forward \n(83). In low-income and middle-income countries, \nissues of vehicle-to-vehicle compatibility are related \nmore to collisions between cars and trucks – both \nfront-to-front impacts, as well as between the front \nof the car and the rear of the truck. The ﬁrst priority \nfor these countries must be to improve the geometry \nand structure of trucks so as to better accommodate \nimpacts from smaller vehicles – not only cars, but \nmotorcycles and bicycles as well ( 82).\n The frontal structures of many new cars are \ncapable of absorbing their own kinetic energy in \ncrashes, so avoiding any signiﬁcant intrusion of the \npassenger compartment. However, there is cur -\nrently no legal control, by means of performance \nrequirements, of the relative degrees of stiffness of \nthe fronts of different models of car. Consequently, \nwhen cars of differing stiffness collide, the stiffer \ncar crushes the weaker car ( 83).\nFront, rear and side under-run guards on trucks\nThe provision of front and rear under-run protec -\ntion on trucks is a well-established means of pre -venting “under-running” by cars (whereby cars go \nunderneath trucks, because of a mismatch between \nthe heights of car fronts and truck sides and \nfronts). Similarly, side protection prevents cyclists \nfrom being run over. It has been estimated that \nthe provision of energy-absorbing front, rear and \nside under-run protection could reduce deaths by \nabout 12% ( 111). It has also been suggested that the \nbeneﬁts would exceed the costs, even if the safety \neffect of these measures was as low as 5% ( 56).\nDesign of non-motorized vehicles\nResearch has shown that ergonomic changes in the \ndesign of bicycles could lead to an improvement in \nbicycle safety ( 23, 112 ). Bicycles display large dif -\nferences in component strength and the reliability \nof their brakes and lighting. About three quarters \nof crashes involving passengers carried on bicycles \nin the Netherlands are associated with feet being \ntrapped in the wheel spokes, and 60% of bicycles \nhave no protective system to prevent this ( 112).\n “Intelligent” vehicles\nNew technologies are creating new opportuni -\nties for road safety as more intelligent systems are \nbeing developed for road vehicles. Vehicles are \nnow starting to be equipped with technology that \ncould improve road safety in terms of exposure, \ncrash avoidance, injury reduction and automatic \npost-crash notiﬁcation of collision ( 113).\n The development of intelligent systems is prin -\ncipally technology-driven. This means that – in \nthe case of many of the features being promoted \n– the implications for road safety, as well as for \nthe behavioural response of users and for public \nacceptance, have to be examined. It is generally \nacknowledged that some devices may distract \ndrivers or affect their behaviour, often in a man -\nner not anticipated by the designers of the system \n(113, 114 ). For these and other reasons, it has been \nstrongly suggested that the development and appli -\ncation of intelligent transport systems should not \nbe left entirely to market forces ( 87, 113 ).\n Examples are presented below of some of the \nmost promising “intelligent” vehicle safety applica -\ntions that are already “on the road” in some form.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 147})","('type', 'Document')"

Measures to increase seat-belt use, \nthrough legislation, information and enforcement \nand smart audible seat-belt reminders are central \nto improving in-car safety.\n Seat-belt reminders are intelligent visual and \naudible devices that detect whether seat-belts are in \nuse in various seating positions and give out increas -\ningly urgent warning signals until the belts are used \n(83). They do not lock the ignition function. Mod -\nern types of seat-belt reminders are different from \nthe older versions that produced a chiming sound \nand a light for four to eight seconds, which proved \nineffective in increasing seat-belt use ( 115).\n In Sweden, 35% of all new cars sold currently \nhave seat-belt reminders ( 116). It is estimated in \nthat country that reminders in all cars could lead \nto national levels of seat-belt use of around 97%, \ncontributing to a reduction of some 20% in car \noccupant deaths ( 117).\n User trials and research in Sweden and the \nUnited States have shown that seat-belt reminders \nwith audible warnings are an effective means of \nincreasing seat-belt use. Preliminary research on \nthe only system currently available in the United \nStates found a 7% increase in seat-belt use among \ndrivers of cars with seat-belt reminders, compared \nwith drivers of unequipped vehicles ( 118). Further -\nmore, a driver survey found that of the two thirds \nwho activated the system, three quarters reported \nusing their seat-belt, and nearly half of all respond -\nents said their belt use had increased ( 119).\n A recent United States National Academy of Sci -\nence report urged the car industry to ensure that \nevery new light-duty vehicle should have, as stand -\nard equipment, an enhanced seat-belt reminder \nsystem for front-seat occupants, with an audible \nwarning and visual indicator that could not be eas -\nily disconnected ( 120).\n An Australian analysis has estimated a cost–ben -\neﬁt ratio of 1:5, for a simple device for drivers only \n(121). A cost–beneﬁt ratio of 1:6 was found when \nseat-belt reminders were introduced in new vehi -\ncles in European Union countries ( 75). Seat-belt reminders provide a cheap and efﬁcient option for \nhelping to enforce seat-belt use.\nSpeed adaptation\nAs stated elsewhere in this report, a variety of \neffective means exist to reduce vehicle speeds \n– including the setting of speed limits according to \nroad function, better road design, and the enforce -\nment of limits by the police, radar and speed cam -\neras. Speed limitation devices in vehicles can assist \nthis process, by controlling the maximum speed a \nvehicle can travel at; some devices are able to set \nvariable limits (see below).\n Insurance statistics show that high-speed cars – \nthose with powerful engines, high acceleration and \nhigh top speeds – are more frequently involved in \ncrashes than cars with lower speed capacities ( 16). \nThe increase in maximum speeds in the past 30 to \n40 years has made it increasingly easy to drive at \ninappropriately fast speeds, thus counteracting the \neffects of measures aimed at improving the safety \nof cars. In 1993, the ten best-selling models of \ncars had top speeds that were double the highest \nnational posted speed limits in Norway ( 16).\n Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) is a system \nbeing developed that shows great promise in terms \nof its potential impact on the incidence of road \ncasualties. With this system, the vehicle “knows” \nthe permitted or recommended maximum speed \nfor the road along which it is travelling.\n The standard system uses an in-vehicle digital \nroad map onto which speed limits have been coded, \ncombined with a satellite positioning system. The \nlevel at which the system intervenes to control the \nspeed of the vehicle can be one of the following:\n— advisory – the driver is informed of the \nspeed limit and when it is being exceeded;\n— voluntary – the system is linked to the \nvehicle controls but the driver can choose \nwhether and when to override it;\n— mandatory – no override of the system is \npossible.\n The potential reduction in the number of fatal \ncrashes for these different types of systems has \nbeen estimated to be in the range 18–25% for \nadvisory systems, 19–32% for voluntary systems, ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 148})","('type', 'Document')"

Speed \nlimit information can in theory be extended to \nincorporate lower speeds at certain locations in the \nnetwork and – in the future – can vary according to \ncurrent network conditions, such as weather con -\nditions, trafﬁc density and the presence of trafﬁc \nincidents on the road.\n Experimental trials have been carried out or \nare under way in Australia, Denmark, the Neth -\nerlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom ( 113). \nBy far the largest trial of a speed adaptation sys -\ntem – the three-year Intelligent Speed Adaptation \nproject – was carried out in four municipalities \nin Sweden. Various types of ISA system were \ninstalled in around 5000 cars, buses and trucks. \nIf the driver exceeded the speed limit, light and \nsound signals were activated. The trial was con -\nducted primarily in built-up areas with speed \nlimits of 50 km/h or 30 km/h, and the test driv -\ners were both private car and commercial driv -\ners. The Swedish National Road Administration \nreported a high level of driver acceptance in urban \nareas of the devices and suggested that they could \nreduce crash injuries by 20–30% in urban areas \n(109, 116 ).\nAlcohol interlocks\nAlcohol ignition interlocks are automatic control \nsystems that are designed to prevent drivers who \nare persistently over the legal alcohol limit from \nstarting their cars if their BAC levels are over the \nlegal driving limit. In principle, these devices can \nbe ﬁtted in any car. As a deterrent, though, they \ncan be ﬁtted in the cars of repeat drink-driving \noffenders, who have to blow into the device before \nthe car will start. If the driver’s BAC is above a \ncertain level, the car will not start. Such devices, \nwhen introduced in vehicles as part of a compre -\nhensive monitoring programme, led to reductions \nof between 40% and 95% in the rate of repeated \noffending ( 123).\n Around half of Canada’s provinces and territories \nhave embarked on alcohol interlock programmes \nand in the United States, most states have passed \nenabling legislation for such devices. Some states \nin Australia have small experimental programmes in progress, involving public transport and com -\nmercial road transport, and the European Union \nis conducting a feasibility study ( 124). In Sweden, \nalcohol interlocks are now installed in over 1500 \nvehicles and, since 2002, two major truck suppliers \nhave been offering interlocks as standard equip -\nment on the Swedish market ( 116).\n If limited to use in dealing with drivers who \nare persistently over the legal alcohol limit, alco -\nhol interlock devices might have only a numeri -\ncally small impact. However, their wider use in \npublic and commercial transport in the future \ncould extend the potential impact of this tool in \ndealing with the problem of drink-driving.\nOn-board electronic stability programmes\nWeather conditions can affect the control of vehicles \nand increase the risk of skidding and crashes due to \nloss of control on wet or icy roads. In such conditions \nan electronic stability programme – an on-board car \nsafety system – can help the car to remain stable \nduring critical manoeuvring. Such devices are now \nbeing introduced onto the market, but they are very \nexpensive. A recent Swedish evaluation of the effects \nof this new technology – the ﬁrst of its kind – pro -\nduced promising results, especially for bad weather \nconditions, with reductions in injury crashes of 32% \nand 38% on ice and snow, respectively ( 125).\nSetting and securing compliance \nwith key road safety rules\nGood enforcement is an integral part of road safety. \nSelf-enforcing road safety engineering measures, as \nwell as new and existing vehicle technologies that \ninﬂuence the behaviour of road users have already \nbeen discussed. This section examines the role of \ntrafﬁc law enforcement by the police and the use of \ncamera technology.\n A major review on trafﬁc law enforcement iden -\ntiﬁed several important ﬁndings ( 126):\n• It is critical that the deterrent be meaningful for \nthe trafﬁc law enforcement to be successful.\n• Enforcement levels need to be high and \nmaintained over a period of time, so as to \nensure that the perceived risk of being caught \nremains high.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 149})","('type', 'Document')"

Much research and international experience \npoint to the effectiveness of setting and enforc -\ning speed limits in reducing the frequency and \nseverity of road crashes ( 16, 129 ). Some examples \nof the impacts of changes in speed limits are given \nin Table 4.4. In addition, the use of variable speed \nlimits – where different speed limits are imposed \nat different times on the same stretch of road – can \nbe effective in managing speed ( 128, 130 ).\nSpeed enforcement on rural roads\nA meta-analysis of speed enforcement on rural roads, \neither by means of radar or instruments which meas -\nure mean vehicle speed between two ﬁxed points, or \nby stationary speed enforcement – where uniformed \npolice ofﬁcers and police cars attend vehicle stopping \npoints – found that the two strategies combined \nreduced fatal crashes by 14% and injury crashes by \n6%. Stationary speed enforcement alone reduced \nfatal and injury crashes by 6% ( 16).\n Leggett described a long-term, low-intensity \nspeed enforcement strategy in Tasmania, Australia, \nthat involved the visible use of single, stationary \npolice vehicles on three high-risk stretches of rural \nroad ( 131). This enforcement strategy resulted in \nan observed reduction in speeding behaviour and \na signiﬁcant decrease in the overall average speed \nof 3.6 km/h. A fall of 58% in serious casualty \ncrashes – fatal crashes and those involving hospi -\ntal admission – was also reported. The two-year \nenforcement programme produced an estimated \ncost–beneﬁt ratio of 1:4 ( 131).\nTABLE 4.4 \nExamples of effects of speed limit changes\nDate Country Type of road Speed limit change Effect of change on speed Effect of change on \nnumber of fatalities \n1985 Switzerland Motorways 130 km/h to\n120 km/h5 km/h decrease in mean speeds 12% reduction \n1985 Switzerland Rural roads 100 km/h to\n80 km/h10 km/h decrease in mean speeds 6% reduction \n1985 Denmark Roads in built-up areas 60 km/h to\n50 km/h3–4 km/h decrease in mean speeds 24% reduction \n1987 USA Interstate highways 55 miles/h (88.5 km/h) \nto 65 miles/h  \n(104.6 km/h)2–4 miles/h (3.2–6.4 km/h)  \nincrease in mean speeds19–34% increase \n1989 Sweden Motorways 110 km/h to\n90 km/h14.4 km/h decrease  \nin median speeds21% reduction\nSource: reproduced from reference 130, with the permission of the publisher.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 150})","('type', 'Document')"

Experience from a range of high-income \ncountries indicates that speed cameras that record \nphotographic evidence of a speeding offence, that \nis admissible in a law court, are a highly effective \nmeans of speed enforcement (see Table 4.5). The \nwell-publicized use of such equipment in places \nwhere speed limits are not generally obeyed and \nwhere the consequent risk of a crash is high has led \nto substantial reductions in crashes ( 113, 132, 134 ). \nThe cost–beneﬁt ratios of speed cameras have been \nreported to range between 1:3 and 1:27 ( 135, 136 ). \nIn several countries, including Finland, Norway \nand the United Kingdom, there has been a high \nsocial acceptance of speed cameras ( 113).\nSpeed limiters in heavy goods and public \ntransport vehicles\nSpeed can also be controlled by “vehicle speed limit -\ners” or “speed governors”, which are devices that can \nbe added to vehicles to limit the maximum speed \nof the vehicle. This device is already being used in \nmany countries in heavy goods vehicles and coaches. \nIt has been estimated that speed governors on heavy \ngoods vehicles could contribute to a reduction of 2% \nin the total number of injury crashes ( 137). In rural areas, speed limitation for buses, minibuses \nand trucks could be valuable ( 46). Given the high \nrepresentation of such vehicles in injury crashes in \nlow-income countries, universal availability of speed \nlimitation on trucks and buses would be an important \nmeans of improving road safety.\nSetting and enforcing alcohol impairment \nlaws\nDespite the progress made in many countries in \ncurbing drink-driving, alcohol is still a signiﬁcant \nand widespread factor in road crashes. The scien -\ntiﬁc literature and national road safety programmes \nagree that a package of effective measures is neces -\nsary to reduce alcohol-related crashes and injuries.\nBlood alcohol concentration limits\nThe basic element of any package to reduce alcohol \nimpairment among road users is establishing a legal \nBAC limit. In many countries, a breath alcohol limit \nis used, for purposes of legal prosecution. Mandatory \nBAC limits provide an objective and simple means by \nwhich alcohol impairment can be detected ( 138). In \naddition, the BAC level gives clear guidance to drivers \nabout safe driving practice. Upper limits of 0.05 g/dl \nfor the general driving population and 0.02 g/dl for \nyoung drivers and motorcycle riders are generally \nconsidered to be the best practice at this time.\nTABLE 4.5\nEstimated safety beneﬁts of speed cameras\nCountry or area Beneﬁts of crash reduction at a system level Beneﬁts of crash reduction at individual crash sites\nAustralia 22% reduction in all crashes in New South Wales\n30% reduction in all crashes on urban arterial \nroads in Victoria\n34% reduction in fatal crashes in Queensland\nNew Zealand 11% reduction in crashes and 20% reduction in casualties \nduring trials of hidden speed cameras \nRepublic of Korea  28% reduction in crashes and 60% reduction in deaths at \nhigh-risk sites\nUnited Kingdom 35% reduction in road trafﬁc deaths and serious injuries \nand 56% reduction in pedestrians killed or seriously \ninjured at camera site\nEurope (various) 50% reduction in all crashes\nVarious countries  \n(meta-analysis)17% reduction in crashes resulting in injuries  \n28% reduction in all crashes in urban areas  \n4% reduction in all crashes in rural areas\nSources: references 16, 113, 132, 133.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 151})","('type', 'Document')"

A variety of \nBAC limits are in place across the \nworld – ranging from 0.02 g/dl to \n0.10 g/dl (see Table 4.6). The most \ncommon limit in high-income \ncountries is 0.05 g/dl; a legal limit \nof 0.10 g/dl corresponds to a three-\nfold increase, and a limit of 0.08  \ng/dl a two-fold increase, in the \nrisk of crash involvement over that \nallowed by a 0.05 g/dl limit.\n Reviews of the effectiveness \nof introducing BAC limits for \nthe ﬁrst time have found that \nthey lead to reductions in alco -\nhol-related crashes, though the \nmagnitude of these effects varies \nconsiderably. When limits are \nsubsequently decreased, research shows that this \nis generally accompanied by further reductions in \nalcohol-related crashes, injuries and deaths ( 138). \nReducing BAC limits from 0.10 g/dl to 0.08 g/dl \n(as was done in some states in the United States) or \nfrom 0.08 g/dl to 0.05 g/dl (in Australia) or from \n0.05 g/dl to 0.02 g/dl (in Sweden) resulted in a \nfall in the number of deaths and serious injuries \n(143–145 ).

"('page_content', '130 •  WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nDeterring excess alcohol offenders\nFor most countries, the level of enforcement of \ndrink-driving laws has a direct effect on the inci -\ndence of drinking and driving ( 147). Increasing \ndrivers’ perception of the risk of being detected is \nthe most effective means of deterring drinking and \ndriving ( 148). “Evidential” breath-testing devices \n(devices that are considered accurate enough for \nthe results to be used as evidence in law courts) are \na means of substantially increasing breath-testing \nactivity. Though used in most high-income coun -\ntries, they are not currently widespread elsewhere. \nThis greatly limits the ability of many countries to \nrespond effectively to the problem of drink-driving.\n The deterrent effect of breath-testing devices is \nto a large extent dependent on the legislation gov -\nerning their use ( 126). Police powers vary between \ncountries, and include the following:\n— stopping obviously impaired drivers;\n— stopping drivers at roadblocks or sobriety \ncheckpoints and testing only those suspected \nof alcohol impairment;\n— stopping drivers at random and testing all \nwho are stopped.\nThe following components have been identiﬁed \nas being central to successful police enforcement \noperations to deter drinking drivers ( 128):\n• A high proportion of people tested (at least one in \nten drivers every year but, if possible, one in three \ndrivers, as is the case in Finland). This can only be \nachieved through wide-scale application of ran -\ndom breath testing and evidential breath testing.\n• Enforcement that is unpredictable in terms of \ntime and place, deployed in such a manner so \nas to ensure wide coverage of the whole road \nnetwork and to make it difﬁcult for drivers to \navoid the checkpoints.\n• Highly visible police operations. For drinking \ndrivers who are caught, remedial treatment \ncan be offered as an alternative to traditional \npenalties, to reduce the likelihood of repeated \noffending.\nRandom breath testing and sobriety checkpoints\nRandom breath testing is carried out in several \ncountries, including Australia, Colombia, France, the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, New Zea -\nland and South Africa. The use of sustained and \nintensive random breath testing is a highly effective \nmeans of reducing injuries resulting from alcohol \nimpairment. In Australia, for instance, since 1993 \nit has led to estimated reductions in alcohol-related \ndeaths in New South Wales of 36% (with one in \nthree drivers tested), in Tasmania of 42% (three \nin four tested) and in Victoria of 40% (one in two \ntested) ( 126).\n An international review of the effectiveness of \nrandom breath testing and sobriety checkpoints \nfound that both reduced alcohol-related crashes \nby about 20% ( 149). The reductions appeared to \nbe similar, irrespective of whether the checkpoints \nwere used for short-term intensive campaigns or \ncontinuously over a period of several years.\n A Swiss study has shown that random breath \ntesting is one of the most cost-effective safety \nmeasures that can be employed, with a cost–ben -\neﬁt ratio estimated at 1:19 ( 150). In New South \nWales, Australia, the estimated cost–beneﬁt ratio \nof random breath testing ranged from 1:1 to  \n1:56 ( 126, 151, 152 ). Similarly, economic analyses \non the sobriety checkpoint programmes in the \nUnited States estimated beneﬁts totalling between \n6 and 23 times their original cost ( 153, 154 ).\nMass media campaigns\nIt is generally accepted that enforcement of alcohol \nimpairment laws is more effective when accompa -\nnied by publicity aimed at: \n— making people more alert to the risk of \ndetection, arrest and its consequences;\n— making drinking and driving less publicly \nacceptable;\n— raising the acceptability of enforcement \nactivities. \n Public support for random breath testing, for \ninstance, has remained high in New South Wales, \nAustralia as a result of extensive public information \nconcerning the measure. \n A recent systematic review demonstrated that \nmass media campaigns that are carefully planned \nand well executed, that reach a sufﬁciently large \naudience, and that are implemented together with ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 153})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 4.  INTERVENTIONS  • 131\nother prevention activities – such as highly-visible \nenforcement – are effective in reducing alcohol-\nimpaired driving and alcohol-related crashes ( 155).  \nIn New Zealand, a recent evaluation of the ﬁve-year \nSupplementary Road Safety Package, which com -\nbines shock advertising with enforcement, found \nthat this combination strategy saved between 285 \nand 516 lives over the ﬁve-year period ( 156).\nPenalties for excess alcohol offenders\nPrison sentences have been given for drink-driving \noffences in several countries, including Australia, \nCanada, Sweden and the United States. According to \nresearch, though, in the absence of effective enforce -\nment such a penalty, in general, has been unsuccess -\nful in deterring drinking drivers or reducing the rate \nof repeat offending ( 148, 157 ). If drivers perceive that \nthe likelihood of their being detected and punished \nis low, then the effect of the penalty, even if severe, is \nlikely to be small. All the same, research suggests that \ndisqualiﬁcation from driving after failing a breath \ntest or refusing to take a breath test may deter drink -\ning drivers – probably because of the swiftness and \ncertainty of the punishment ( 157).\nInterventions for high-risk offenders \nHigh-risk offenders are usually deﬁned as those \nwith BAC levels in excess of 0.15 g/dl. In many \nindustrialized countries, driver rehabilitation \ncourses are available to offenders, though the \ncomponents of such courses vary widely. Stud -\nies that have followed participants subsequent to \ndrink-driving rehabilitation courses have shown, \nwhere participants are motivated to address their \nproblems, that the courses reduce the rate of reof -\nfending ( 158, 159 ).\nMedicinal and recreational drugs\nLegal requirements for police powers to carry out \ndrug testing vary. Powers to carry out a blood or \nurine test exist in many countries to determine \nwhether a driver is unﬁt to drive as a result of con -\nsuming drugs. The relationship between the use \nof drugs and involvement in road crashes is still \nlargely unclear. Considerable research, though, is \ncurrently being undertaken to gain greater under -standing of this subject. Enforcement strategies that \ndeter people from driving while under the inﬂu -\nence of drugs still have to be developed. Research is \nalso being carried out in this area, to ﬁnd efﬁcient \nand cost-effective screening devices to help enforce \nlaws on drug use and driving.\nDrivers’ hours of work in commercial and \npublic transport\nThe previous chapter outlined the risks associated \nwith cumulative fatigue as a result of lack of sleep, \nnight driving and working shifts. Research indi -\ncates that fatigue is most prevalent among long-\ndistance truck drivers ( 160) and that it is a factor \nin 20–30% of crashes in Europe and the United \nStates involving commercial road vehicles ( 161, \n162). A recent review of research on fatigue among \ncommercial transport drivers in Australia found \nthat between 10% and 50% of truck drivers drove \nwhile fatigued on a regular basis. The self-reported \nuse of pills taken to stay awake in the long-distance \nroad transport industry varies between 5% and \n46% ( 163).\n The normal pattern of work of commercial \ndrivers is inﬂuenced by strong economic and social \nforces. Arguments about safety are usually ignored \nin many places, for commercial reasons ( 161, 164–\n166). However, an estimated 60% of the overall \ncosts of trafﬁc crashes involving commercial trucks \nin the United States are borne by society, rather \nthan by the truck operators ( 167).\n Working time – which often determines the \ntime since the last signiﬁcant period of sleep – is \nmore critical to fatigue than actual driving time. \nRestrictions on driving hours that do not take into \naccount when the driving occurs, forcing drivers to \nwork according to shifting schedules, can result in \ngreater sleep deprivation and make it difﬁcult for \nthe drivers’ circadian rhythms to adapt ( 161).\n Buses, coaches and commercial road transport \nare the only areas that are covered by speciﬁc leg -\nislation. It is increasingly recognized, though, that \nregulations on working and driving times need to \nbe broadened. Drivers and operators, for instance, \nneed training and information on fatigue and how \nto manage it.

Safety experts \nbelieve that the policies on driving and working \nhour limits should take greater account of the sci -\nentiﬁc evidence on fatigue and crash risk and, in \nparticular, of the following:\n• Daily and weekly rest . The risk of being involved \nin a crash doubles after 11 hours of work \n(168). Sufﬁcient time and proper facilities for \nmeal breaks and daily rest and recuperation \nneed to be provided. Where breaks cannot be \ntaken at physiologically suitable times of the \nday, proper time must be given for full recu -\nperation on a weekly, or shorter, basis.\n• Night work . The risk of fatigue-related crashes \nat night is 10 times greater than during the \nday ( 161). The number of permissible working \nhours during the period of low circadian activ -\nity should be substantially less than the number \npermitted during the day.\n• Working and driving time . There should be a coor -\ndinated approach to regulating driving and \nworking time to ensure that permissible driv -\ning times do not inevitably lead to unacceptably \nhigh working times that double crash risk.\n Some new vehicle technologies – such as on-\nboard driver monitoring systems – promise to help \nin the detection of fatigue and excessive working \nhours. Road design standards urgently need to take \nbetter account of current knowledge of the causes \nand characteristics of crashes due to fatigue and \ninattention, and more research is needed to set \ngood standards of road design to help prevent such \ncrashes ( 163). While such technological advances \ncan certainly help, none of them is a substitute for \na proper regime of regulated working hours and its \nrigorous enforcement.\nCameras at trafﬁc lights\nCrashes at junctions are a leading source of road trafﬁc \ninjury. In addition to improved junction layout and \ndesign and the replacement, where appropriate, of \nsignal-controlled junctions by roundabouts, research \nhas shown that cameras can also be cost-effective \nin reducing crashes at junctions with trafﬁc lights.  Cameras at trafﬁc lights take photographs of vehicles \ngoing through the lights when the signal is red. In \nAustralia, the introduction of such cameras in the late \n1980s led to a 7% reduction in all crashes and a 32% \nreduction in front-to-side impacts at sites with cameras \n(169). In the United States, it was found that following \nthe introduction of cameras at sites in Oxnard, Cali -\nfornia, the number of injury crashes fell by 29% and \nthe number of front-to-side impacts involving injury \nfell by 68%, with no increase in rear impacts ( 170). A \nmeta-analysis of studies of the effectiveness of cameras \nat trafﬁc lights has shown that they are associated with \na 12% reduction in the number of injury crashes ( 16). \nA cost–beneﬁt analysis of cameras at trafﬁc lights in the \nUnited Kingdom calculated that the return was nearly \ntwice the investment after one year and 12 times the \ninvestment after ﬁve years ( 171).\nSetting and enforcing seat-belt and child \nrestraint use\nSeat-belts\nThe level of seat-belt use is inﬂuenced by:\n— whether there is legislation mandating their \nuse;\n— the degree to which enforcement of the law, \ncomplemented by publicity campaigns, is \ncarried out;\n— incentives offered to encourage use.\n The time series shown in Figure is 4.1 is based on \n30 years of experience in Finland with using seat-\nbelts. It shows how legislation for compulsory use, \nwithout accompanying penalties, publicity or enforce -\nment, has only a temporary effect on usage rates.\nMandatory seat-belt use laws\nMandatory seat-belt use has been one of road injury \nprevention’s greatest success stories and has saved \nmany lives. Occupant restraints ﬁrst began to be ﬁt -\nted in cars in the late 1960s, and the ﬁrst law on their \nmandatory use was passed in Victoria, Australia, in \n1971. By the end of that year, the annual number of \ncar occupant deaths in Victoria had fallen by 18%, \nand by 1975 by 26% ( 173). Following the experience \nof Victoria, many countries also introduced seat-belt \nlaws, which have led to many hundreds of thou -\nsands of lives saved worldwide.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 155})","('type', 'Document')"

In the United Kingdom, for \ninstance, front seat-belt usage rose from 37% before \nthe introduction of the law to 95% a short period \nafterwards, with an accompanying fall of 35% in \nhospital admissions for road trafﬁc injuries ( 174, \n175). The wide variation in seat-belt use in Euro -\npean Union countries means that substantial further \nsavings – estimated at around 7000 deaths annually \n– could be achieved if the usage rate was raised to \nthe best that exists globally. In 1999, the best rates \nfor seat-belt use recorded in high-income countries \nwere in the 90–99% range for front-seat occupants, \nand in the 80–89% range for those in rear seats \n(128). Seat-belt use legislation in low-income coun -\ntries is still not universal, and will become increas -\ningly important as levels of car trafﬁc rise.\n The cost–beneﬁt ratio of mandatory seat-belt use \nhas been estimated at between 1:3 and 1:8 ( 16).\nEnforcement and publicity\nResearch has shown that primary enforcement  – where \na driver is stopped solely for not wearing a seat-belt \n– is more effective than secondary enforcement  – where \na driver can only be stopped if another offence has \nbeen committed ( 176, 177 ). Primary enforcement can increase seat-belt use, even where the level of \nuse is already high ( 178). \n Many studies, at both national and local levels, \nhave shown that enforcement increases seat-belt \nuse if it meets certain conditions. The enforcement \nneeds to be selective, highly visible and well pub -\nlicized, conducted over a sufﬁciently long period \nand repeated several times during a year ( 179–183 ). \nSelective Trafﬁc Enforcement Programmes and \nsimilar programmes have been introduced in \nFrance, in parts of the Netherlands and in several \nstates of the United States. Generally, wearing rates \nhave been found to be around 10–15% higher than \nthe baseline level, a year after the activities were \ncarried out ( 184). Studies have estimated that the \ncost–beneﬁt ratio of such seat-belt enforcement \nprogrammes is of the order of 1:3 or more ( 172).\n The Selective Trafﬁc Enforcement Programmes \ncarried out in Canadian provinces have achieved \nimprovements in seat-belt use, resulting in high \nrates of use. While the programmes differ across \nprovinces in their details, their basic elements are \nbroadly similar and include:\n— an information brieﬁng, educating police \nforces about the issue and its importance;\n— following this campaign, a period of one \nto four weeks of intensive enforcement by ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 156})","('type', 'Document')"

In 1987 , \nprior to the start of the programme seat-belt use of \ndrivers was 72%, and that of front-seat passengers \n67%. Figure 4.2 shows the incremental increases in \nseat-belt use – up to rates in excess of 90% – of driv -\ners and front-seat passengers, from the introduction \nof the programme until 1994 ( 185, 186 ).\n The reasons why this type of programme has \nhad such success include ( 186):\n• The programme is seen as a safety, rather \nthan as an enforcement measure, as a result \nof public information before the programme \nstarted.\n• The perceived risk of being caught is \nincreased, because of the wide media cover -\nage and police visibility.\n• The provision of incentives (see below) \nstrengthens the safety message and results in \neven higher police visibility.\n• Feedback on the programme’s progress moti -\nvates both the public and police.\n• The programme is greater than the sum of its \nseparate elements, that is to say, its individual \nelements reinforce each other.\n In the Republic of Korea, in the second half \nof 2000, the government set a target to increase \nseat-belt use from 23% to 80% by 2006. By August \n2001, efforts to increase seat-belt use that included \npublicity, enforcement and a 100% increase in ﬁnes \nfor offenders, led to a spectacular increase in usage \nfrom 23% to 98%, a rate that was sustained in 2002 \n(133).\n Six months after the introduction of legislation on \nseat-belt use in Thailand, a study in four cities found \nthat the proportion of drivers wearing seat-belts had \nactually decreased. The reason for this is unclear, but \nit may have been related to problems with the con -\nsistent enforcement of the law ( 187).Incentive programmes\nIncentives programmes have been devised to \nenhance police enforcement of seat-belt use in a \nnumber of countries. In these programmes, seat-\nbelt use is monitored and seat-belt wearers are \neligible for a reward. The rewards may range from \na meal voucher or lottery ticket to sizeable prizes \nsuch as video recorders or free holidays ( 188). In \ngeneral, such programmes appear very effective \nand have a high level of acceptance. A meta-analy -\nsis of 34 studies examined the effects of incentives \non seat-belt use, and found the size of the effect to \nbe related to a number of variables, such as the tar -\nget population, the initial baseline rate of seat-belt \nuse and the prospect of immediate rewards ( 184).\nChild restraints\nThe high level of effectiveness of child restraints in \nreducing fatal and serious injuries was discussed in the \nprevious chapter. Good protection requires that the type \nof restraint used is appropriate for the age and weight of \nthe child. Several restraint types exist and are covered by \ninternational standards. These include ( 189):\n• Rear-facing infant seats : for infants up to 10 kg, \nfrom birth to 6–9 months, or for infants up to \n13 kg, from birth to 12–15 months.1987 1 988 1 989 1990Percentage of drivers/fr ont-seat passengers\nwearing seat-belts\n60708090100\n1991 1 992 1993 1994\nYearFront-seat passengersDriversFIGURE 4.2\nUse of seat-belts by car drivers/front-seat passengers \nin Saskatchewan, Canada, 1987–1994\nSource: reference 185.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 157})","('type', 'Document')"

As men -\ntioned in the previous chapter, while research has \nshown that rear-facing seats offer more protec -\ntion than forward-facing seats, there are risks \nattached to placing rear-facing seats on the front \nseat directly in front of the passenger air bag. There \nshould be clear instructions to avoid ﬁtting rear-\nfacing child restraints in this way. Devices exist \nthat can automatically detect child restraints and \noccupants out of their normal position on the front \nseat, and switch off the passenger air bag.\n As regards child restraint usage in low-income \ncountries, cost and availability are important factors.\nMandatory child restraint laws\nA review of studies on the effects of mandatory \nchild restraint laws in the United States concluded \nthat such laws have led to an average reduction of \n35% in fatal injuries, a 17% decrease in all injuries \nand a 13% increase in child restraint use ( 190, 191 ).\n While most cars in high-income countries are \nﬁtted with adult restraint systems, child restraint \nuse requires informed decisions on the part of par -\nents or guardians regarding design, availability and \ncorrect ﬁtting. A further issue is the fact that age-\nrelated child seats can only be used for a limited \nperiod and the cost of replacing them could deter \nparents from doing so. As mentioned earlier, the incorrect ﬁtting and \nuse of child equipment is a signiﬁcant problem that \ndecreases the potential safety beneﬁts of these sys -\ntems. Standardized anchorage points in cars would \nhelp to resolve many of these problems. Proposals \nfor an international requirement have been dis -\ncussed for many years, but not agreed as yet.\n In the absence of child seats, it is important that \nadults are made to understand that they should \navoid carrying children on their laps. The forces in \na crash are such that, whatever action adults may \ntake, they are unlikely to save an unbelted child \nfrom injury ( 192).\nChild restraint loan programmes\nChild restraint loan programmes are widely avail -\nable in high-income countries. For a small fee or \nwithout charge, parents can have the loan of an \ninfant seat from the maternity ward where the \nchild is born. A further beneﬁt of such schemes is \ntheir strong educational value and the opportunity \nthey afford for precise advice to be given to the \nparents. The schemes have strongly affected usage \nrates of infant seats and also the use of appropriate \nchild restraints throughout childhood ( 191, 193 ).\nSetting and enforcing mandatory crash \nhelmet use\nBicycle helmets\nAs already mentioned, the use of bicycle helmets \nhas been found to reduce the risk of head and brain \ninjuries by between 63% and 88% ( 194–196 ). As \nwith other safety equipment, measures to increase \nthe use of bicycle helmets involve a variety of \nstrategies. A range of bicycle helmet standards \nis used worldwide. While there continues to be \ndebate about whether mandatory use is appropri -\nate – reﬂecting concerns that mandatory use could \ndeter people from the otherwise healthy pursuit of \ncycling – the effectiveness of bicycle helmets for \nroad safety is not at all in doubt ( 195) (see Box 4.5). \nIn general, bicycle helmet use worldwide is low.\n A meta-analysis of studies has shown that the \nmandatory wearing of cycle helmets has reduced \nthe number of head injuries among cyclists by \naround 25% ( 16).

"('page_content', '136 •  WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\ncampaigns promoting the use of cycle helmets, the \nstate of Victoria in Australia introduced the world’s \nﬁrst law requiring cyclists to wear helmets. The rate \nof helmet wearing increased from 31% immediately \nbefore to 75% in the year following the new legis -\nlation and was associated with a 51% reduction in \nthe numbers of crash victims who were admitted to \nhospital with head injuries or who died. Substantial \nincreases in use were observed among all age groups, \nalthough rates of use were lowest among teenagers \n(205). Mandatory bicycle helmet laws introduced in \nNew Zealand in 1994 also resulted in large increases \nin helmet use, and reductions in the number of head \ninjuries of between 24% and 32% in non-motorized \nvehicle crashes and of 19% in motor vehicle crashes \n(203). Currently the rate of helmet wearing in New \nZealand is around 90%, in all age groups ( 206).\n Together with legislation on their use, helmet pro -\nmotion programmes organized by community-wide \ngroups, using a variety of educational and publicity strategies, have been shown to be effective in increas -\ning helmet wearing in the United States ( 207). A law \nin Florida, United States, requires all riders under 16 \nyears to wear a helmet; its introduction, which was \naccompanied by supporting strategies such as pro -\ngrammes in school on bicycle safety and the provi -\nsion of free helmets for poorer people, led to a decline \nin the rate of bicycle-related injuries, from 73.3 to \n41.8 per 100 000 population ( 208). In Canada, rates \nof helmet use rose rapidly following the introduction \nof mandatory laws for cyclists, and these rates were \nsustained over the next two years with regular educa -\ntion and enforcement by the police ( 198).\n Cost–beneﬁt ratios for cycle helmets have been \nestimated at around 1:6.2 for children, 1:3.3 for \nyoung adults and 1:2.7 for adults ( 16).\nMotorcycle helmets\nThere are various strategies that effectively address \nthe problem of head injuries in motorcyclists. They \nBOX 4.5\nBicycle helmets\nThe incidence of bicycle-related injuries varies between countries. This is partly due to factors such as the road design, \nthe trafﬁc mix, climate and cultural attitudes ( 197). Over three quarters of fatal bicycle injuries are due to head injury \n(198). Among children, bicycle injuries are the leading cause of head injury ( 199).\n There is now good evidence that bicycle helmets are effective in reducing head injuries. Early population-based \nresearch found that bicycle helmets reduced the risk of this type of injury by about 85% ( 200). More recent studies \nagree with this ﬁnding, with the estimated protective effects ranging from 47% to 88% ( 195, 201 ).\n To promote the wearing of bicycle helmets, many governments have introduced legislation making bicycle \nhelmets mandatory. During the 1990s, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States brought in such laws. \nSince then, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iceland and Spain have followed suit. In the majority of cases, the laws \nhave been directed at children and young people up to 18 years of age; only in Australia and New Zealand does the \nlegislation cover bicyclists of all ages ( 197).\n Evaluations of mandatory bicycle helmet laws have been encouraging. Findings from Canada, for instance, in \nthose provinces where legislation has been introduced, show a 45% reduction in the rates of bicycle-related head \ninjury ( 202). In New Zealand, it has been estimated that there was a 19% reduction in head injuries among cyclists \nover the ﬁrst three years, following the introduction of bicycle helmet laws ( 203).\n Those opposed to bicycle helmet legislation argue that wearing bicycle helmets encourages cyclists to take \ngreater risks and therefore makes them more likely to incur injuries. To date, this argument has not found empirical \nevidence to support it. Other opponents have suggested that bicycle helmet legislation reduces the number of cyclists \nand it is for this reason that there are fewer head injuries. The most recent evidence, though, suggests the contrary: \nthe number of child cyclists in Canada actually increased in the three years following the introduction of bicycle \nhelmet laws ( 204).\n There is unequivocal evidence that bicycle helmets reduce both the incidence and severity of head, brain and \nupper facial injuries. Making the wearing of bicycle helmets compulsory, together with improvements to the road \nenvironment that improve safety for cyclists, is therefore an effective strategy for reducing bicycle-related injuries.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 159})","('type', 'Document')"

A recent European \ninitiative has recently reviewed, and subsequently \nrevised, existing helmet standards in the light of \ncurrent knowledge and crash research ( 209).\n In low-income countries, it would be highly \ndesirable for effective, comfortable and low-cost \nhelmets to be developed and local manufactur -\ning capacity increased. The Asia Injury Prevention \nFoundation, for instance, has developed a light -\nweight tropical helmet for use in Viet Nam and has \ndrawn up standards for helmet performance. In \nMalaysia, the ﬁrst standard for motorcycle helmets \nfor adults was drafted in 1969 and updated in 1996. \nThe country is now developing helmets specially \ndesigned for children ( 210).\nMandatory laws on helmet wearing \nIncreasing helmet wearing through the legislation \nrequiring their use is important, especially in low-\nincome countries where motorized two-wheeler \nuse is high and current levels of helmet wearing \nlow. It has been suggested that when a motorcycle \nis purchased, the acquisition of an approved helmet \nshould be mandated, or at least encouraged, espe -\ncially in low-income countries ( 17).\n In Malaysia, where legislation on the use of \nhelmets was introduced in 1973, it was estimated \nthat the law led to a reduction of about 30% in \nmotorcycle deaths ( 211). In Thailand, in the year \nfollowing the enforcement of the law on wear -\ning helmets, their use increased ﬁve-fold, while \nmotorcycle head injuries decreased by 41.4% and \ndeaths by 20.8% ( 212).\n An evaluation of helmet use and traumatic \nbrain injury, before and after the introduction of \nlegislation, in the region of Romagna, Italy, found \nthat helmet use increased from an average of less \nthan 20% in 1999 to over 96% in 2001, and was an effective measure for preventing traumatic brain \ninjury at all ages ( 213).\n A meta-analysis of studies – mainly from the \nUnited States, where many laws on helmets were \nintroduced in the period 1967–1970, around a half of \nwhich were repealed between 1976 and 1978 – found \nthat the introduction of laws on compulsory helmet \nwearing reduced the number of injuries to moped \nriders and motorcyclists by 20–30% ( 16). Similarly, \nthe analysis of the effects of repealing helmet wear -\ning laws showed that withdrawing them led to an \nincrease of around 30% in the numbers of fatal inju -\nries, and an increase of 5–10% in injuries to moped \nriders and motorcyclists ( 16). A recent study on the \nrepeal of laws in the United States found that observed \nhelmet use in the states of Kentucky and Louisiana \ndropped from nearly full compliance, when the laws \nwere still operative, to around 50%. After the repeal \nof the laws, motorcycle deaths increased by 50% in \nKentucky and by 100% in Louisiana ( 214).\n Economic evaluations of mandatory helmet \nwearing laws, based largely on experience in the \nUnited States, found high cost–beneﬁt ratios, rang -\ning from 1:1.3 to 1:16 ( 215).\nThe role of education, information and \npublicity\nPublic health sector campaigns in the ﬁeld of road \ninjury prevention have encompassed a wide range \nof measures, but education has always featured as \nthe mainstay of prevention ( 216). In the light of \nongoing research and experience of the systems \napproach to road injury prevention, many profes -\nsionals in the ﬁeld have re-examined the role that \neducation plays in prevention ( 26, 216, 217 ). It is \nclear that informing and educating road users can \nimprove knowledge about the rules of the road and \nabout such matters as purchasing safer vehicles and \nequipment. Basic skills on how to control vehicles \ncan be taught. Education can help to bring about a \nclimate of concern and develop sympathetic atti -\ntudes towards effective interventions.

However, when used in isolation, education, \ninformation and publicity do not generally deliver \ntangible and sustained reductions in deaths and \nserious injuries ( 26, 190, 217 ). Historically, consider -\nable emphasis has been placed on efforts to reduce \nroad user error through trafﬁc safety education \n– for example, in pedestrian and cycle education \nfor school children, and in advanced and remedial \ndriver training schemes. Although such efforts can \nbe effective in changing behaviour ( 218), there is no evidence that they have been effective in reducing \nrates of road trafﬁc crashes ( 218, 219 ) (see Box 4.6).\nDelivering post-crash care\nChain of help for patients injured in road \ncrashes\nThe aim of post-impact care is to avoid prevent -\nable death and disability, to limit the severity of the \ninjury and the suffering caused by it, and to ensure \nthe crash survivor’s best possible recovery and \nreintegration into society. The way in which those \nBOX 4.6\nEducational approaches to pedestrian safety\nEducating pedestrians on how to cope with the trafﬁc environment is considered an essential component of \nstrategies to reduce pedestrian injuries and has been recommended in all types of countries.\n In order to reach the two groups of pedestrians that are particularly vulnerable – children and older people \n– educational programmes use a variety of methods, frequently in combination. These approaches include talks, \nprinted materials, ﬁlms, multi-media kits, table-top models, mock-ups of intersections, songs and other forms of \nmusic. Education is provided either directly to the target population or indirectly – through parents or teachers, for \ninstance – and in various settings, such as the home, the classroom or a real trafﬁc situation.\n Most studies on the effectiveness of educational programmes report on surrogate outcomes, such as observed \nor reported behaviour, attitudes and knowledge. From a public health perspective, though, the main outcomes \nof interest are crashes, deaths, injuries and disabilities. The studies reporting these outcomes tend to have \nmethodological limitations which reduce their usefulness for comparative purposes. Limitations include the absence \nof randomization for assigning subjects to intervention and control groups ( 220–223 ), the absence of detailed data \nfor control groups ( 221), or the lack of a control group ( 224).\n A systematic review ( 218), including 15 randomized controlled trials that measured the effectiveness of \nprogrammes of safety education for pedestrians, found:\n• There was a lack of good evidence for adults, particularly in the case of elderly people.\n• There was a lack of good evidence from low-income and middle-income countries.\n• The quality of the studies was fairly poor, even in randomized controlled studies.\n• The variety of intervention models and of methods of measuring outcomes made comparisons between studies \ndifﬁcult.\n• Only surrogate outcomes were reported.\n• While a change in knowledge and attitudes in children was conﬁrmed, the size of the measured effect varied \nconsiderably.\n• A change in behaviour was found in children, but not in all studies, and the size of the effect was inﬂuenced by \nthe method of measuring, as well as by the context, such as whether a child was alone or with other children.\n• The effect of education on the risk of a pedestrian incurring an injury remains uncertain.\n Overall, the effect of safety education of pedestrians on behaviour varied considerably. Knowledge of pedestrian \nsafety in children can translate into changed attitudes and even into appropriate forms of behaviour, but there is \nuncertainty about the extent to which the observed behavioural changes persist over time. There is no evidence that \nobserved behaviour is causally related to the risk of occurrence of pedestrian injury. If it is, though, there is no reliable \ninformation about the size of the effect of pedestrian behaviour on the frequency of pedestrian injuries. Reliable \nscientiﬁc information on the effectiveness of educational approaches to pedestrian safety in low-income and middle-\nincome countries is lacking. Also needing more research is the effectiveness of educational approaches in all countries \nwith elderly pedestrians.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 161})","('type', 'Document')"

For those patients taken \nto hospital, around 15% of deaths occurred within \nthe ﬁrst four hours after the crash, but a much \ngreater proportion, around 35%, occurred after \nfour hours ( 225). In reality, therefore, there is not \nso much a “golden hour” in which interventions \nhave to take place ( 226) as a chain of opportuni -\nties for intervening across a longer timescale. This \nchain involves bystanders at the scene of the crash, \nemergency rescue, access to the emergency care \nsystem, and trauma care and rehabilitation.\nPre-hospital care\nAs already pointed out in the previous chapter, the \nvast majority of road trafﬁc deaths in low-income \nand middle-income countries occur in the pre-\nhospital phase ( 227). In Malaysia, for instance, \n72% of motorcycle deaths occur during this phase \n(228). At least half of all trauma deaths in high-\nincome countries are pre-hospital deaths ( 225, \n227). A number of options exist for improving \nthe quality of pre-hospital care. Even where these \noptions are cheap, they are frequently not taken up \nto sufﬁcient extent ( 229).\nRole of lay bystanders\nThose who are present or who arrive ﬁrst at the \nscene of a crash can play an important role in vari -\nous ways, including:\n— contacting the emergency services, or calling \nfor other forms of help;\n— helping to put out any ﬁre;\n— taking action to secure the scene (e.g. pre -\nventing further crashes, preventing harm to \nrescuers and bystanders, controlling the crowd \ngathered at the scene);\n— applying ﬁrst aid.\n Many deaths from airway obstruction or exter -\nnal haemorrhage could be avoided by lay bystand -\ners trained in ﬁrst aid ( 230). In low-income and some middle-income coun -\ntries, rescue by ambulance occurs in the minority \nof cases and assistance from a lay bystander is the \nmain source of health care for the victims. In Ghana, \nfor example, the majority of injured patients who \nreach hospital do so by means of some form of com -\nmercial vehicle ( 227, 231 ). It has been suggested that \nbasic ﬁrst-aid training for commercial drivers might \nbe helpful ( 227), though it has not been scientiﬁcally \nestablished whether such a measure would decrease \npre-hospital mortality ( 229).\n A pilot project on pre-hospital care training was \nconducted in Cambodia and northern Iraq, in areas \nwith a high density of landmines where people \nwere frequently injured ( 232). The ﬁrst stage of \nthe project involved giving 5000 lay people a basic \ntwo-day training course in ﬁrst aid. These people \nwould be “ﬁrst responders” in landmine explo -\nsions. In the second stage, paramedics were given \n450 hours of formal training. A rigorous evalua -\ntion was conducted of the effects of the project \non landmine-related injuries in the two areas, \nusing an injury surveillance system. Among those \nseverely injured in the areas covered by the project, \nthe mortality rate fell from 40% before the project \nto 9% afterwards. The project relied on training \nand some basic supplies and equipment, but did \nnot provide vehicles, such as formal ambulances. \nTransportation continued to be provided by the \nexisting system of public and private vehicles in \neach area.\n Similar pilot programmes have taken place, or \nare being conducted, involving training for lay \n“ﬁrst responders” or others who are not health care \nprofessionals but who might have occasion to come \nupon injured people on a regular basis. They include \ntraining for police in Uganda and for the lay public \ngenerally in India, though evaluations have not yet \nbeen published of these two programmes.\n Programmes providing ﬁrst-aid training to the \nlay public, either generally or to particular popu -\nlation groups – such as the police, commercial \ndrivers or village health workers – should follow \ncertain principles to help strengthen their impact. \nFor instance, such programmes should:\n— base the contents of their training on epide -')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 162})","('type', 'Document')"

While some low-income coun -\ntries have started rudimentary ambulance services \nin urban areas, they are still the exception as far as \nmost of sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia is \nconcerned ( 229). International reviews have urged \ncaution in transferring emergency medical systems \nfrom high-income countries to low-income coun -\ntries, questioning whether such actions represent \nthe best use of scarce resources. Another concern \nis the lack of conclusive evidence on the beneﬁts of \nsome Advanced Life Support measures commonly \nused in high-income areas, such as pre-hospital \nendotracheal intubation and intravenous ﬂuid \nresuscitation ( 233–235 ). Further research is clearly \nneeded on the effectiveness and cost-effective -\nness of such more advanced measures. Research is \nequally called for on the role of Basic Life Support \ntraining in low-income countries – particularly in \nrural areas, where there is no formal emergency \nmedical system and it might take days to reach pro -\nfessional medical care ( 229).\n In high-income countries, access to the emer -\ngency medical system is almost always made by \ntele-phone, but the coverage and reliability of \nthe telephone link varies between countries. The \ngrowth in the use of mobile telephones, even in \nlow-income and middle-income countries, has \nradically improved emergency access to medical \nand other assistance. In many countries, there is \na standard emergency telephone number that can \nbe dialled for urgent assistance. Uniform codes \nfor emergency assistance, for land telephones and \nmobile phones, should be set up in all regions of \nthe world.Emergency rescue services\nPolice and ﬁreﬁghters often arrive at the crash \nscene before personnel from the emergency medi -\ncal service. Early intervention by ﬁreﬁghters and \nrescuers is critical where people are trapped in a \nvehicle, particularly if it is on ﬁre or submerged \nunder water. Fireﬁghters and police need to be \ntrained, therefore, in basic life support. There \nshould be close cooperation between ﬁreﬁghters \nand other groups of rescuers, as well as between \nﬁreﬁghters and health care providers ( 225).\n As mentioned earlier, there are risks associated \nwith ambulance transport, both for those trans -\nported by the ambulance as well as people in the \nstreet. Safety standards must therefore be established \nfor transportation by ambulance – for instance, on \nthe use of child restraints and adult seat-belts.\nThe hospital setting\nThere is growing understanding in high-income \ncountries of the principal components of hospital \ntrauma care and an awareness of what aspects \nrequire further research. Many improvements have \ntaken place in trauma care over the last 30 years, \nlargely as a result of new technology and improve -\nments in organization ( 236). Clinical capabilities \nand stafﬁng, equipment and supplies, and trauma \ncare organization are all issues considered by medi -\ncal experts to be of great importance ( 225, 237 ).\nHuman resources\nTraining for teams managing trauma care is vital. It \nis generally acknowledged that the standard for such \ntraining in high-income countries is the Advanced \nTrauma Life Support course of the American College \nof Surgeons ( 225, 229, 238 ). The applicability of this \ncourse to low-income and middle-income coun -\ntries, though, has yet to be established.\n The problems faced by low-income countries \nin relation to human resources, equipment and \nthe organization of services have already been \ndiscussed. Though little has been documented on \neffective ways to deal with these problems, there \nis some evidence of successful practice ( 229).

Several low-income coun -\ntries in Africa have adapted South Africa’s programme \nto their own circumstances, which generally include a \nlack of high-tech equipment and practical difﬁculties \nin referring patients to higher levels of care ( 236).\n Apart from short in-service training, there also \nneeds to be more formal, in-depth training. This \nincludes improving the trauma-related training \nreceived by doctors, nurses and other profession -\nals, both in their basic education and in postgradu -\nate training.\nPhysical resources\nMany hospitals in low-income and middle-income \ncountries lack important trauma-related equip -\nment, some of which is not expensive.\n In Ghana, for instance, as mentioned in the previ -\nous chapter, a survey of 1 1 rural hospitals found that \nnone had chest tubes and only four had emergency \nairway equipment. Such equipment is vital for treating \nlife-threatening chest injuries and airway obstruction, \nmajor preventable causes of death in trauma patients. \nAll of it is cheap and much is reusable. The survey \nsuggested that a lack of organization and planning, \nrather than restricted resources, was to blame ( 241). \nSimilar deﬁciencies have been documented in other \ncountries. In public hospitals in Kenya, shortages of \noxygen, blood for transfusion, antiseptics, anaesthet -\nics and intravenous ﬂuids have been recorded ( 242). \nResearch is urgently needed on this problem. It is \nimportant, too, to draw on relevant experience from \nother ﬁelds. National blood transfusion centres, for \nexample, with their management of blood for trans -\nfusions – which involves recruiting suitable donors \nand collecting blood, screening donated blood for \ntransfusion-transmissible infections, and ensuring \nthat a safe blood supply is constantly available at places \nthroughout the country.Organization of trauma care\nA prerequisite for high-quality trauma care in hos -\npital emergency departments is the existence of a \nstrategy for the planning, organization and provision \nof a national trauma system. There is considerable \npotential worldwide to upgrade arrangements for \ntrauma care and improve training in trauma care at \nthe primary health care level, in district hospitals and \nin tertiary care hospitals. International guidelines for \nthis, based on research, need to be established.\n The Essential Trauma Care Project is a collabora -\ntive effort between the WHO and the International \nSociety of Surgery that aims to improve the plan -\nning and organization of trauma care worldwide \n(243). The project seeks to help individual counties, \nin developing their own trauma services, to:\n— deﬁne a core of essential injury treatment \nservices;\n— deﬁne the human and physical resources \nnecessary to assure such services in the best \npossible way, given particular economic and \ngeographic contexts;\n— develop administrative mechanisms to \npromote these and related resources on \na national and international basis; such \nmechanisms will include speciﬁc training \nprogrammes, programmes to improve qual -\nity and hospital inspections.\n While the goals of the Essential Trauma Care \nProject extend beyond the ﬁeld of road safety, the \nsuccess of the project can only be beneﬁcial for \ncrash-related trauma care.\nRehabilitation\nFor every person who dies in a road trafﬁc crash, \nmany more are left with permanent disabilities.\n Rehabilitation services are an essential component \nof the comprehensive package of initial and post-hos -\npital care of the injured. They help to minimize future \nfunctional disabilities and restore the injured person to \nan active life within society. The importance of early \nrehabilitation has been proved, though best practice in \ntreatment programmes has yet to be identiﬁed ( 225). \nMost countries need to increase the capacity of their \nhealth care systems to provide adequate rehabilitation \nto survivors of road trafﬁc crashes.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 164})","('type', 'Document')"

In low-income and middle-income \ncountries, efforts should focus on capacity building \nand personnel training so as to improve the man -\nagement of survivors of road trafﬁc crashes in the \nacute phase, and thus prevent, as far as possible, the \ndevelopment of permanent disability.\n Medical rehabilitation services involve profes -\nsionals from a range of disciplines. These include \nspecialists in physical medicine and rehabilitation, \nas well as in other medical or paramedical ﬁelds, \nsuch as orthopaedics, neurosurgery and general \nsurgery, physical and occupational therapy, pros -\nthetics and orthotics, psychology, neuropsychol -\nogy, speech pathology and nursing. In every case, \nthe recovery of both the patient’s physical and \nmental health is paramount, as well as their abil -\nity to become independent again and participate in \ndaily life.\n Medical rehabilitation services also play a vital \npart in helping those living with disabilities to \nachieve independence and a good quality of life. \nAmong other things, these services can provide \nmechanical aids that greatly assist affected indi -\nviduals to be reintegrated into, and participate in, \nordinary daily activities, including their work. Such \naids, delivered through outpatient departments or \noutreach services to the home, are often essential in \npreventing further deterioration. In many countries, \nonce acute management has been accomplished \nand mechanical aids provided, community-based \nrehabilitation remains the only realistic means of \nreintegrating the individual into society.\nResearch\nMuch of the research on the effectiveness and \ncost–beneﬁts of interventions takes place in high-\nincome countries. The development of national \nresearch capacity is thus an urgent need in many \nother parts of the world ( 244, 245 ). Experience from high-income countries shows the importance \nof having at least one – preferably independent \n– national organization receiving solid core fund -\ning that deals with road safety research.\n Encouraging the development of professional \nexpertise across a range of disciplines at national \nlevel, together with regional cooperation and \nexchange of information, have reaped much ben -\neﬁt in industrialized countries. Developing these \nmechanisms should be a priority where they do \nnot exist. Among the many research-related needs \nfor road injury prevention, the following are some \nof the more pressing:\n• Better collection and analysis of data, so as \nto enable more reliable estimates to be made \nof the global burden of road trafﬁc injuries, \nespecially in low-income and middle-income \ncountries. This includes mortality data, \nconforming to internationally-standardized \ndeﬁnitions, and data on acute morbidity and \nlong-term disability. There should also be \nmore research to ﬁnd low-cost methods of \nobtaining these data.\n• Further data on the economic and social \nimpacts of road trafﬁc injuries, especially in \nlow-income and middle-income countries. \nThere is a considerable lack of economic \nanalysis in the ﬁeld of road injury prevention \nin these countries. The cost of injuries is not \nknown empirically, neither are the cost nor \ncost-effectiveness of interventions.\n• Studies demonstrating the effectiveness of \nspeciﬁc interventions for injuries in low-\nincome and middle-income countries.\n• Design standards and guidelines for intercity \nroads carrying mixed trafﬁc. \n The following areas require particular research:\n— how best to assess the effectiveness of pack -\nages of road safety measures combining \ndifferent actions, such as area-wide trafﬁc \ncalming and urban design;\n— the interaction between transport planning \nand urban and regional planning, and how \nthese affect road safety;\n— the design of roads and trafﬁc management, \ntaking into account trafﬁc environments and ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 165})","('type', 'Document')"

INTERVENTIONS  • 143\ntrafﬁc mixes encountered in low-income \nand middle-income countries;\n— how successfully various types of preventive \nmeasures can be transferred between coun -\ntries with differing socioeconomic condi -\ntions and differing rates of motorization and \ntrafﬁc mixes.\n Research in low-income and middle-income \ncountries needs to be carried out on a regional \nbasis towards developing the following:\n— light, well-ventilated motorcycle helmets;\n— safer bus and truck fronts;\n— standards for motorcycle crash protection;\n— the visibility and crash protection of indig -\nenously-designed vehicles.\n Improvements in post-impact care at an afford -\nable cost are a priority area for the health sector. \nEqually important is research to better understand \nthe mechanisms causing head injury and whiplash \ninjury in road crashes, and treatments for these \ninjuries. There is currently, for instance, no effec -\ntive pharmacological treatment for head injury.\n In all countries, further research is required into \nmanaging exposure to risk – the least-used injury \nprevention strategy. It is also essential to resolve the \ngrowing incompatibility in many places between \nsmaller, lighter vehicles and larger, heavier ones.\nConclusion\nSubstantial research and development over the last \n30 years have proved that a range of interventions \nexist to prevent road crashes and injury. The gap, \nthough, between what is known to be effective and \nwhat is actually practised is often considerable. As \nwith other areas of public health, road injury pre -\nvention requires effective management to put in \nplace sustainable, evidence-based measures, over -\ncoming obstacles to their implementation.\n Good transport and land-use policies offer a \nmeans of reducing the exposure to risk for road \ncrash injury. Safety-conscious planning and design \nof the road network can minimize the risk of \ncrashes and crash injury. Crash-protective features \non a vehicle can save lives and reduce injuries for \nroad users, both inside and outside the vehicle. \nCompliance with key road safety rules can be signiﬁ -cantly increased using a combination of legislation, \nenforcement of the laws, and information and edu -\ncation. The availability of good quality emergency \ncare can save lives, and greatly reduce the severity \nand long-term consequences of road injuries.\n A large proportion of road trafﬁc injuries in low-\nincome and middle-income countries occur among \nvulnerable road users. An important priority must \ntherefore be to introduce a wide range of measures \nthat give these road users greater protection. All the \nprevention strategies described in this report call for \na wide mobilization of effort, at all levels, involving \nclose collaboration across many disciplines and sec -\ntors, prominent among which is the health sector.\n Despite many attempts to ﬁnd and document \nexamples of “good practice” in road safety in \ndeveloping countries, such examples seem to be \nfew. This chapter, therefore, remains slanted to a \ndescription of what has been successful in highly-\nmotorized countries. This is not to say that the \ninterventions presented in this chapter will not \nwork in low-income or middle-income countries \n– indeed, many of them do. There needs, though, \nto be further testing of prevention strategies, to \nﬁnd ways to adapt them to local conditions – and \nnot merely to adopt and apply them unchanged.\nReferences\n1.

"('page_content', 'CHAPTER 5.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  • 157\nRoad trafﬁc crashes occur on all continents, in \nevery country of the world. Every year they take \nthe lives of more than a million people and inca -\npacitate many millions more. Pedestrians, users of \nnon-motorized vehicles – including bicycles, rick -\nshaws and carts – and motorcyclists in low-income \nand middle-income countries carry a large pro -\nportion of the global burden of road trafﬁc death \nand serious injury. The elderly, children and the \ndisabled are particularly vulnerable.\n Despite the growing burden of road trafﬁc inju -\nries, road safety has received insufﬁcient attention \nat both the international and national levels. The \nreasons include lack of general awareness and spe -\nciﬁc information on the scale of the problem, on \nthe health, social and economic costs of road trafﬁc \ncrashes, and on the interventions that can prevent \ncrashes or reduce the harm they cause.\n Another reason is that the problem of road trafﬁc \ncrashes and injuries does not “belong” to any spe -\nciﬁc agency, either at national or international levels. \nInstead, responsibility for dealing with the various \naspects of the problem – including the design of vehi -\ncles, the design of road networks and roads, urban \nand rural planning, the introduction and enforce -\nment of road safety legislation, and the care and treat -\nment of crash survivors – is divided among many dif -\nferent sectors and groups. There has usually been no \nleader to ensure that they coordinate their efforts and \naddress the problem as a whole. In this environment, \nit is not surprising that political will has frequently \nbeen lacking to develop and implement effective road \nsafety policies and programmes.\nMain messages from the report\nThis report, the ﬁrst joint report between WHO \nand the World Bank on the topic, presents the cur -\nrent knowledge about road trafﬁc injuries and the \nactions that need to be taken in order to tackle the \nproblem. The following are some of the report’s \nkey messages:\n• Any road trafﬁc system is highly complex and \nhazardous to human health. Elements of the \nsystem include motor vehicles, roads and road \nusers, and their physical, social and economic \nenvironments. Making a road trafﬁc system less hazardous requires a “systems approach” \n– understanding the system as a whole and \nthe interaction between its elements, and \nidentifying where there is potential for inter -\nvention. In particular, it requires recognition \nthat the human body is highly vulnerable to \ninjury and that humans make mistakes. A safe \nroad trafﬁc system is one that accommodates \nand compensates for human vulnerability and \nfallibility.\n• Road trafﬁc injuries are a huge public health \nand development problem, killing almost \n1.2 million people a year and injuring or \ndisabling between 20 million and 50 million \nmore. Both WHO and World Bank data show \nthat, without appropriate action, these inju -\nries will rise dramatically by the year 2020, \nparticularly in rapidly-motorizing countries. \nNot only is 90% of the current burden borne \nby low-income and middle-income coun -\ntries, but the increase in casualty rates will \nbe greatest in these countries. Although data \non the costs of road trafﬁc crashes are sparse, \nparticularly from low-income and middle-\nincome countries, it is clear that the economic \nimpact of these injuries on individuals, fami -\nlies, communities and nations is enormous, \ncosting countries between 1% and 2% of their \ngross national product. In addition, there is \nthe heavy and tragic burden on those directly \naffected, both physically and psychologically \n– as well as on their families, friends and \ncommunities. Health facilities and their often \nmeagre budgets are greatly overstretched in \ndealing with survivors of road trafﬁc crashes.\n• Many countries have no injury surveillance \nsystems that generate reliable data on road traf -\nﬁc crashes and injuries. Indicators, especially \nfor non-fatal outcomes, may not be standard -\nized, making comparisons difﬁcult. There are \nfrequently discrepancies between data – for \nexample, between police and health-related \nsources. Furthermore, widespread under-\nreporting of road trafﬁc fatalities and injuries \n– both in health and police data – limits the \nusefulness of existing data sources.

"('page_content', '158 •  WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\ndata are needed to provide a solid foundation \nfor road safety planning and decision-making. \nEstablishing simple, cost-effective injury sur -\nveillance systems is an important step towards \nimproving road safety. However, the lack of \nreliable data should not impede immediate \naction. Much can be achieved by adapting and \napplying proven safety practices. \n• A number of factors affecting the probability \nof a road trafﬁc injury need to be considered \nwithin the systems approach. The various \ntypes of risk related to road trafﬁc injury, and \nthe factors inﬂuencing these risks, are:\n— For exposure to risk , the determinants include \neconomic and demographic factors, level \nof motorization, modes of travel, the vol -\nume of unnecessary trips and land-use \nplanning practices.\n— For crash occurrence , the risk factors include \nexcessive speed, drinking and driving, \nunsafe vehicles, unsafe road design, and \nthe related lack of effective law enforce -\nment and safety regulations.\n— For injury severity , the risk factors include the \nnon-use of seat-belts, child restraints and \ncrash helmets; lack of “forgiving” vehicle \nfronts to protect pedestrians in a collision; \nroadside infrastructure that is unprotective \nin a crash; and human tolerance factors.\n— For post-crash injury outcomes , the risk factors \ninclude delays in detecting a crash and \nproviding life-saving measures and psy -\nchological assistance; lack of or delayed \nemergency care on the spot and transport \nto a health facility; and the availability and \nquality of trauma care and rehabilitation.\n• Road safety is a shared responsibility (see Box \n5.1). Reducing the risk in the world’s road \ntrafﬁc systems requires commitment and \ninformed decision-making by government, \nindustry, nongovernmental organizations and \ninternational agencies and participation by \npeople from many different disciplines, such \nas road engineers, motor vehicle designers, \nlaw enforcement ofﬁcers and health profes -\nsionals and community groups.• Vision Zero in Sweden and the sustainable \nsafety programme in the Netherlands are \nexamples of good practice in road safety. Such \ngood practice can also have other beneﬁts. It \ncan encourage healthier lifestyles involving \nmore walking and cycling and can reduce \nthe noise and air pollution that result from \nmotor vehicle trafﬁc. Colombia is an example \nof a developing country that is beginning to \nimplement a similar strategy.\n• The important role that public health can \nplay in the prevention of road trafﬁc injuries \nincludes: the collection and analysis of data in \norder to demonstrate the health and economic \nimpact of road trafﬁc crashes; research on risk \nfactors; the implementation, monitoring and \nevaluation of interventions; the delivery of \nappropriate primary prevention, care and \nrehabilitation for injured people; and advo -\ncacy for greater attention to the problem. \n Road trafﬁc crashes are predictable and can \nbe prevented. Many high-income countries have \nshown sharp reductions in crashes and casualty \nnumbers over the past couple of decades. This has \nbeen achieved by adopting a systems approach to \nroad safety that emphasizes environment, vehicle \nand road user interventions, rather than solely \nfocusing on direct approaches aimed at changing \nthe behaviour of road users. Although solutions for \nlow-income and middle-income countries may dif -\nfer from those that have a longer history of motori -\nzation, some basic principles are the same. These \ninclude, for example, good road design and trafﬁc \nmanagement, improved vehicle standards, speed \ncontrol, the use of seat-belts and the enforcement of \nalcohol limits. The challenge is to adapt and evalu -\nate existing solutions, or else create new solutions in \nlow-income and middle-income countries.\n Transferring and adapting some of the more com -\nplex measures are more long-term goals and require \ncountry-speciﬁc research and development. In addi -\ntion, more work is called for in all countries to ﬁnd \nnew and better road safety measures. For example, \nprovision of safer fronts on new designs of motor \nvehicles is urgently needed to reduce the harm caused \nin vehicle collisions with pedestrians and cyclists.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 181})","('type', 'Document')"

With \nproperly targeted investment, countries should derive \nconsiderable social and economic beneﬁts from \nreduced road trafﬁc deaths, injuries and disabilities.\nRecommended actions\nThis report offers governments the opportunity \nto assess the current status of road safety in their \ncountry, review policies and institutional arrange -\nments and capacity, and take appropriate actions. \nAll the following recommendations should be \naddressed across a wide range of sectors and dis -\nciplines if they are to achieve success. However, \nthe recommendations should be treated as ﬂexible \nguidelines. They leave much room for adaptation \nto local conditions and capacities.\n In certain low-income and middle-income coun -\ntries with limited human and ﬁnancial resources, it \nmay be difﬁcult for governments to apply some of these recommendations on their own. In these cir -\ncumstances, it is suggested that countries work with \ninternational or nongovernmental organizations or \nother partners to implement the recommendations.\nRecommendation 1: Identify a lead \nagency in government to guide the \nnational road trafﬁc safety effort\nEach country needs a lead agency on road safety, \nwith the authority and responsibility to make deci -\nsions, control resources and coordinate efforts by all \nsectors of government – including those of health, \ntransport, education and the police. This agency \nshould have adequate ﬁnances to use for road safety, \nand should be publicly accountable for its actions.\n Experience across the world has shown that dif -\nferent models can be effective in road safety and that \neach country needs to create a lead agency appropri -\nate to its own circumstances. The agency might take \nthe form, for example, of a designated, stand-alone \nbureau, or a committee or cabinet representing sev -\neral different government agencies.

The agency \nmight undertake much of the work itself or else it \nmight delegate work to other organizations, includ -\ning provincial and local governments, research \ninstitutes or professional associations.\n Speciﬁc efforts should be taken by the agency \nto engage all signiﬁcant groups concerned in road \nsafety, including the wider community. Awareness, \ncommunication and collaboration are key to estab -\nlishing and sustaining national road safety efforts.\n National efforts will be boosted if one or more \nwell-known political leaders can actively cham -\npion the cause of road safety. \nRecommendation 2: Assess the problem, \npolicies and institutional settings relat -\ning to road trafﬁc injury and the capacity \nfor road trafﬁc injury prevention in each \ncountry\nAn important element in dealing with road safety is \nascertaining the magnitude and characteristics of the \nproblem, as well as the policies, institutional arrange -\nments and capacity within the country to deal with \nroad trafﬁc injuries. This includes an understanding \nnot only of the volume of trafﬁc deaths, injuries and \ncrashes, but also of which road users are most affected; \nin which geographic areas the greatest problems are \nfound; what risk factors are contributing; what road \nsafety policies, programmes and speciﬁc interventions \nare in place; what institutional structures are address -\ning the road trafﬁc injury problem; and what their \ncapacity is. Intermediate outcome measures – such \nas mean speeds, rates of seat-belt wearing, and rates \nof helmet wearing – can also be useful and can be \nobtained through simple surveys.\n Possible sources of data include: police; health \nministries and health care settings; transport minis -\ntries; insurance ﬁrms; motor vehicle manufacturing \ncompanies; and government agencies collecting data \nfor national planning and development. However, \nthe accuracy, consistency and thoroughness of these \ndata should be assessed before making use of them.\n Information systems on road trafﬁc deaths and \ninjuries should be simple and cost-effective to \nimplement, appropriate to the skill levels of the \nstaff using them, and consistent with national and international standards. \n Standards that could be easily and proﬁtably \nadopted include: the use of the 30-day trafﬁc fatal -\nity deﬁnition; the International Statistical Classiﬁ -\ncation of Diseases and Related Health Problems; \nthe International Classiﬁcation of External Causes \nof Injury (ICECI); and the injury surveillance and \nsurvey guidelines developed by WHO and its col -\nlaborating centres.\n Data should be widely shared among the rel -\nevant authorities and concerned groups, particu -\nlarly those responsible for trafﬁc, law enforcement, \nhealth and education.\n The economic impact of road trafﬁc injuries in \nmost countries is substantial. Where this is pos -\nsible, assessing the direct and indirect economic \ncosts of road trafﬁc injuries, in particular relative \nto gross national product, can help increase aware -\nness of the scale of the problem.\n A lack of data, though, should not dissuade gov -\nernments from beginning to implement many of \nthe other recommendations made in this report.\nRecommendation 3: Prepare a national \nroad safety strategy and plan of action\nEach country should prepare a road safety strat -\negy that is multisectoral – involving agencies \nconcerned with transport, health, education, \nlaw enforcement and other relevant sectors \n– and multidisciplinary – involving road safety \nscientists, engineers, urban and regional plan -\nners, health professionals and others. The strat -\negy should take the needs of all road users into \naccount, particularly vulnerable road users, and \nshould be linked to strategies in other sectors. It \nshould involve groups from government, the pri -\nvate sector, nongovernmental organizations, the \nmass media and the general public.\n A national road safety strategy needs to set \nambitious but realistic targets for at least ﬁve or \nten years. It should have measurable outcomes and \nsufﬁcient funding to develop, implement, man -\nage, monitor and evaluate actions. Once the road \nsafety strategy is prepared, a national action plan, \nscheduling speciﬁc actions and allocating speciﬁc \nresources, should be developed.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 184})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', '162 •  WORLD REPORT ON ROAD TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION\nRecommendation 4: Allocate ﬁnancial and \nhuman resources to address the problem\nWell-targeted investment of ﬁnancial and human \nresources can reduce road trafﬁc injuries and deaths \nconsiderably. Information from other countries on \ntheir experience with various interventions can \nhelp a government in assessing the costs against the \nbeneﬁts of speciﬁc interventions and set priorities \nbased on which interventions are likely to be the \nbest investment of scarce ﬁnancial and human \nresources. Similar cost–beneﬁt analyses of possible \ninterventions in other areas of public health can help \nset overall government priorities for expenditure on \npublic health.\n Countries may have to identify potential new \nincome sources to afford the investment needed to \nachieve road safety targets. Examples include fuel \ntaxation, road and parking charges, vehicle registra -\ntion fees and ﬁnes for trafﬁc violations. Area-wide \nsafety assessments, at the proposal stage of projects \nthat may inﬂuence road safety, and safety audits, as \nprojects are carried through to completion, can help \nmake optimal use of limited resources.\n Many countries do not have the human resources \nrequired to develop and implement an effective road \nsafety programme and therefore need to develop \nthese resources. Appropriate training programmes \nshould be a priority. Such training should cover spe -\ncialist ﬁelds – such as statistical analysis, road design \nand trauma care – as well as ﬁelds cutting across \ndisciplines – such as urban and regional planning, \npolicy analysis and development, road trafﬁc plan -\nning and health planning.\n WHO is currently developing a curriculum for \nteaching the prevention of road trafﬁc injury in \nschools of public health and other settings. Several \ninternational networks, including the Injury Pre -\nvention Initiative for Africa and the Road Trafﬁc \nInjury Network, currently provide training, as do \nmany schools of public health and engineering.\n International conferences – such as the World \nConferences on Injury Prevention and Safety Pro -\nmotion, the International Conferences on Alcohol, \nDrugs and Trafﬁc Safety (ICADTS), the conferences \nof the International Trafﬁc Medicine Association \n(ITMA) and the congresses of the World Road Association (PIARC) – provide opportunities to \nexchange knowledge, establish networks and \npotential partnerships, and strengthen country \ncapacity.\n Efforts should be made to increase attendance \nby representatives from low-income and middle-\nincome countries at these conferences and to involve \nthem in setting global and regional agendas for road \nsafety.\nRecommendation 5: Implement speciﬁc \nactions to prevent road trafﬁc crashes, \nminimize injuries and their consequences \nand evaluate the impact of these actions\nSpeciﬁc actions are needed to prevent road traf -\nﬁc crashes and to minimize their consequences. \nThese actions should be based on sound evidence \nand analysis of road trafﬁc injuries, be culturally \nappropriate and tested locally, and form part of the \nnational strategy to address the problem of road \ncrashes (see Box 5.2). \n Chapter 4 discussed road safety interventions in \ndetail, in particular, their effects on reducing the \nfrequency and severity of crashes, as well as their \ncost-effectiveness, where data were available. No \nstandard package of interventions is suitable for all \ncountries. However, all countries can follow sev -\neral good practices, including:\n• incorporating as a long-term goal, safety fea -\ntures into land-use and transport planning  \n– such as the provision of shorter and safer \npedestrian and bicycle routes and convenient, \nsafe and affordable public transport – and road \ndesign , including controlled crossings for \npedestrians, rumble strips and street lighting;\n• setting and enforcing speed limits  appropriate \nto the function of speciﬁc roads;\n• setting and enforcing laws requiring seat-belts \nand child restraints  for all motor vehicle occu -\npants;\n• setting and enforcing laws requiring riders of \nbicycles and motorized two-wheelers to wear \nhelmets ;\n• setting and enforcing blood alcohol concen -\ntration limits  for drivers, with random breath \ntesting at sobriety checkpoints; ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 185})","('type', 'Document')"

Only 20% of the surfaced roads are in a satisfactory state of repair.\n In Costa Rica, trafﬁc crashes and their consequences are clearly a public health problem. They are the leading \ncause of violent deaths, the leading cause of death in the 10–45 years age group, and the third leading cause of \nyears of life lost due to premature death. The cost to the country of trafﬁc crashes amounts to almost 2.3% of gross \ndomestic product.\n Because of the seriousness and complexity of the road safety problem, a set of coordinated interventions, cutting \nacross many sectors and disciplines, has been formulated.

A national road safety plan, aimed at reducing the \nmortality rate by 19% during the period 2001–2005, is being implemented, providing for action in the ﬁelds of trafﬁc \nlaws, police surveillance, education, infrastructure and research.\nTrafﬁc laws and police surveillance\nThe law has been changed so as to better protect pedestrians, and new laws have been introduced making the \nwearing of safety-belts by drivers and passengers compulsory. The police have stepped up operations to check for \nexcess alcohol among drivers, to control speeding and to check on the wearing of seat-belts.\nEducation\nOngoing campaigns emphasize the importance of observing speed limits and wearing seat-belts, and discourage \ndrinking and driving, in support of police enforcement campaigns. Special campaigns take place during the Easter \nweek, when large numbers of people take to the roads. A speciﬁc safety campaign is aimed at pedestrians. The \nmedical examination that drivers require has been updated and strengthened.\n Within primary and secondary schools at all levels, the national plan provides for educational modules on road \nsafety.\nInfrastructure\nUnder Costa Rica’s road safety plans, new infrastructure is being put in place to protect vulnerable road users, \nincluding pedestrian bridges, cycle tracks, and protective railings and pavements along dangerous portions of roads. \nNew and better road signs and trafﬁc lights are being installed.\nResearch\nSystematic data on road trafﬁc crashes and on the victims of crashes are compiled. Studies are also under way \nnationally on a range of issues, including:\n— the safety of road travel to and from schools;\n— risk behaviour among drivers and pedestrians;\n— the wearing of safety-belts;\n— the vulnerability of road users visiting health centres;\n— safety audits of roads, and the identiﬁcation of high-risk crash sites;\n— the ﬁnancial costs and economic consequences of trafﬁc crashes.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 186})","('type', 'Document')"

Currently, the level of support given \nto road safety is far below that for other health \nproblems of comparable magnitude. Few multilat -\neral donors have included road safety among their \npriority areas for funding. With some exceptions, \nsuch as the FIA, Volvo and Rockefeller Founda -\ntions, few foundations to date have provided \nsigniﬁcant funding for international road safety \nprogrammes. Several global and regional United Nations \nor intergovernmental agencies are active in road \nsafety. Although there have been joint efforts, \nlittle coordinated planning between these agen -\ncies takes place on any large scale. In addition, no \nlead agency takes responsibility for ensuring that \nsuch coordinated planning takes place. This situ -\nation must change so that responsibility is clearly \nassigned, speciﬁc roles are allocated to speciﬁc \nagencies, duplication is avoided and a ﬁrm com -\nmitment is forthcoming to produce and imple -\nment a global plan for road safety.\n There ﬁrst needs to be a forum where those \ninvolved can meet and discuss the development \nof such a global plan. The plenary meeting of the \nUnited Nations General Assembly taking place \non 14 April 2004 is a milestone in this direc -\ntion. A follow-up process, though, is needed. \nThis process should include regular meetings of \nrelevant government ministers so as to develop \nand endorse a global plan of action or charter for \nroad safety, consistent with other global initiatives \nsuch as the Millennium Development Goals.\n Finally, international nongovernmental organiza -\ntions and the private sector can help raise awareness \nlocally and globally, as committed citizens, employ -\ners and socially responsible corporate entities.\nConclusion\nThis report attempts to contribute to the body of \nknowledge on road safety. It is hoped that it will \ninspire and facilitate increased cooperation, inno -\nvation and commitment to preventing road trafﬁc \ncrashes around the world.\n Road trafﬁc crashes are predictable and there -\nfore preventable. In order to combat the problem, \nthough, there needs to be close coordination and \ncollaboration, using a holistic and integrated \napproach, across many sectors and many disci -\nplines.\n While there are many interventions that can \nsave lives and limbs, political will and commit -\nment are essential and without them little can be \nachieved.

"('page_content', 'STATISTICAL ANNEX  • 167\nBackground\nEach year, over 100 countries send detailed \ninformation on the number of deaths from various \ndiseases, illnesses or injuries to WHO. Around half \nof these are the more developed countries of the \nAmericas, Asia and Europe. The less developed \ncountries in the Americas account for nearly a \nfurther third, with the less developed countries of \nAsia contributing most of the remainder. Only a \nfew African countries contribute mortality data to \nWHO ( 1). Data from these WHO Member States are \ncompiled from vital registration systems using the \nInternational Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) codes  \n(2, 3). National vital registration systems capture \nabout 18 million deaths that occur annually \nthroughout the world. Data from these registration \nsystems, as well as from surveys, censuses, \nepidemiological studies and health service systems, \nare analysed by WHO to determine patterns of causes \nof death for countries, regions and the world.\n WHO also uses these data, along with other \ninformation, to assess the global burden of dis -\nease. The ﬁrst assessment of the global burden of \ndisease was published in 1996 ( 4), and at the time \nrepresented the most comprehensive examination \nof global mortality and morbidity ever produced. The methodologies employed for estimating the \nglobal burden of disease have since been reﬁned and \nimproved, and in 2000 a new assessment was under -\ntaken. The Global Burden of Disease project for 2000 \n(GBD 2000 project) makes use of all available and \nrelevant information to generate the best possible \npopulation-based data on mortality and morbidity \nthat is available today. Even for regions and causes \nof death where data are sparse, the GBD uses all the \nevidence at hand and the best available methods to \nmake inferences ( 5). Estimates of the global burden \nof injury for the year 2002 are presented here. These \ndata are based on the most recent WHO cause of \ndeath analyses and on previously unanalysed health \nservice data from 18 Member States.

The cause list used \nfor the GBD 2000 project has four levels of disag -\ngregation and includes 135 speciﬁc diseases and \ninjuries ( 5). Overall mortality is divided into three \nbroad groups of causes, as follows:\n— Group I: communicable diseases, maternal \ncauses, conditions arising in the perinatal \nperiod and nutritional deﬁciencies;\n— Group II: noncommunicable diseases;\n— Group III: intentional and unintentional injuries.\n Injury categories within Group III are deﬁned in \nterms of external cause codes. The codes for road \ntrafﬁc injuries are as follows:\n• ICD-9 codes: E810–E819, E826–E829, E929.0.\n• ICD-9 basic tabulation list codes: B471–B472.\n• ICD-10 codes: V01–V04, V06, V09–V80, V87, \nV89, V99. Absolute numbers and rates per 100 000 in the \npopulation are presented by sex and WHO region for \nthe age groups: 0–4 years, 5–14 years, 15–29 years, \n30–44 years, 45–59 years and 60 years or older.\nWHO regions\nWHO Member States are grouped in six regions: \nthe African Region, the Region of the Americas, \nthe South-East Asia Region, the European Region, \nthe Eastern Mediterranean Region and the Western \nPaciﬁc Region. The countries included in each of \nthese regions are indicated in Table A.5.\n Countries within the six WHO regions are fur -\nther divided by income level according to 2002 \nestimates of gross national income (GNI) per capita \nas compiled by the World Bank ( 6). On the basis of \nthe GNI per capita, economies are classiﬁed as low \nincome (US$ 735 or less), middle income (US$ \n736–9075) or high income (US$ 9076 or more).\nGlobal estimates of mortality due to \ninjury\nThe GBD 2000 project uses the latest population \nestimates for WHO Member States prepared by \nthe United Nations Population Division ( 7). WHO \nhas worked extensively with Member States in an \neffort to verify the best sources of recent data on \nvital registration and cause of death, and new life \ntables for the year 2000 have been constructed for \nall 192 WHO Member States ( 8, 9). The results \nfor road trafﬁc injuries reported in Table A.2 are \nderived from Version 1 of the GBD calculations for \n2002 and are based on extensive analysis of mortal -\nity data for all regions of the world, together with \nsystematic reviews of epidemiological studies and \nhealth service data ( 5). Complete or incomplete vital \nregistration data together with sample registration \nsystems cover 72% of global mortality. Survey data \nand indirect demographic techniques provide infor -\nmation on levels of child and adult mortality for the \nremaining 28% of estimated global mortality.\n Data on causes of death have been analysed to \ntake into account incomplete coverage of vital reg -\nistration in countries and the likely differences in \ncause-of-death patterns that would be expected in \nthe uncovered and often poorer subpopulations ( 5).

"('page_content', 'STATISTICAL ANNEX  • 169\nFor example, the patterns of causes of death in China \nand India were based on existing mortality regis -\ntration systems. In China, the disease surveillance \npoints system and the vital registration system of the \nMinistry of Health were used. In India, mortality \ndata from the medical certiﬁcate of cause of death \nwere used for urban areas and the annual survey of \ncause of death was employed for rural areas.\n For all other countries lacking vital registration \ndata, cause-of-death models were used to gener -\nate an initial estimate of the maximum likelihood \ndistribution of deaths across the broad categories of \ncommunicable and noncommunicable diseases and \ninjuries, based on estimated total mortality rates and \nincome. A regional model pattern of speciﬁc causes \nof death was then constructed from local vital \nregistration data and data from verbal autopsies (a \nmethod of medically determining the cause of death \nbased on interviews with the next of kin or care-\ngivers). This proportionate distribution was then \napplied within each broad group of causes. Finally, \nthe resulting estimates were adjusted according to  \nother epidemiological evidence from studies on spe -\nciﬁc diseases and injuries.\n Special attention has been paid to problems of \nmisattribution or miscoding of causes of death in \ncardiovascular diseases, cancer, injuries and gen -\neral ill-deﬁned categories. The category “Injury \nundetermined whether accidentally or purposely \ninﬂicted” (E980–E989 in the 3-digit ICD-9 codes \nor Y10–Y34 in ICD-10) can often include a sig -\nniﬁcant share of deaths due to injury. Except where \nmore detailed local information is available, these \ndeaths have been proportionately allocated to the \nother injury causes of death. Deaths coded to the   \n4-digit ICD-9 code E928.9, “Unspeciﬁed accidents”, \nhave also been redistributed proportionally across \nthe other unintentional injury categories. There \nis no corresponding ICD-10 code for unspeciﬁed \naccidents, forcing coders to specify at least a broad \ncategory of injury.\nGlobal and regional ranking of deaths  \nand DALYs\nThe DALY measure is used to quantify the burden \nof disease ( 4, 10). The DALY is a health-gap measure that combines information on the number of years \nof life lost from premature death with the loss of \nhealth from disability.\n Years lived with disability (YLDs) are the dis -\nability component of DALYs. YLDs measure the \nequivalent healthy years of life lost as a result of \ndisabling sequelae of diseases and injuries. They \nrequire estimation of incidence, average duration \nof disability and severity of disability.\n The analysis of the burden of injury in the \nGBD 2000 project is based on the methods devel -\noped for the 1990 project. A decision was made \nto retain all 1990 disability weights relating to \ninjury in the GBD 2000 project until more reﬁned \nmethods for this aspect of the burden of disease \ncalculations are developed ( 11). The GBD 1990 \nproject methods deﬁne a case of injury as one \nsevere enough to warrant medical attention or \none that leads to death. \n Many sources of information were used to \nestimate YLDs for diseases and injuries in the \nGBD 2000 project. These included national and \ninternational surveillance data and disease reg -\nistries, health survey data, data on use of hospi -\ntal and medical services, and international and \ncountry-speciﬁc epidemiological studies ( 5).  \n The results reported here rely on new analyses \nof health facility data obtained after an extensive \nperiod of negotiation and consultation with \nselected Member States (Table A.1). These data \nwere used to develop ratios of death to incidence. \nThe ratios were then applied to extrapolate YLDs \nfrom injury deaths for all regions of the world. \nThe death-to-incidence ratios were quite consist -\nent across developed and developing countries. The \nproportion of incident cases resulting in long-term \ndisabling sequelae was estimated for each nature of \ninjury category from a review of long-term epide -\nmiological studies of injury outcomes.\n To produce the rankings in Table A.3, deaths \nand disabilities were ﬁrst divided into the three \nbroad groups of causes mentioned earlier. Next, \ndeaths and disabilities within each of these broad \ngroupings were divided into categories. For \nexample, injuries were divided between unin -\ntentional and intentional injuries.

Unin -\ntentional injuries, for example, were subdivided \ninto road trafﬁc injuries, poisonings, falls, ﬁres, \nand drowning. The same procedure was followed \nfor the other two broad groups of causes of deaths \nand disabilities. The rankings were produced by \nordering the subcategories.\n The 12 leading causes of death and DALYs are \nreported in Table A.3 for all WHO Member States \nand for each of the six WHO regions. In regions \nwhere road trafﬁc injury-related deaths and DALYs \nrank below the 12 leading causes, the actual rank \norder is reported.\nCountry-level rates of mortality\nThe numbers and rates of mortality related to road \ntrafﬁc injuries presented in Table A.4 are for the \nmost recent year between 1992 and 2002 reported \nto WHO by Member States. Considerable differ -\nences exist in the degree of completeness of the \nvital registration data submitted by countries. In \nsome countries, the vital registration data system \ncovers only a part of the country (for exam -\nple, urban areas or some provinces). In others, \nalthough the vital registration data system covers \nthe whole country, not all deaths are registered. For \nChina and India, death registration covers only part \nof the population, and a sample registration system \nprovides a representative sample of deaths for the \nrest of the population, allowing WHO to estimate \nthe total numbers of deaths by cause for the whole \npopulation of each country.\n For Member States with incomplete vital reg -\nistration systems, WHO has used demographic \ntechniques to estimate the level of completeness of \ndeath recording for the speciﬁed population, so as \nto be able to calculate death rates. These estimates \nof completeness are available on the WHO web site \nas part of the WHO mortality database. The num -\nbers and rates of mortality related to road trafﬁc \ninjuries reported in Table A.4 have been adjusted \nfor incompleteness where the estimated complete -\nness is less than 100%. A simple numerical adjust -\nment applying the fractional completeness has \nbeen used, rather than the more complex cause-of-death modelled adjustments used in the GBD \ncomputations for 2002.\n Rates are not calculated where the number of \ndeaths in a particular category was less than 20, \nthough the absolute number of deaths is reported. \nAge-speciﬁc and age-standardized rates are \nreported, with the latter calculated by applying the \nage-speciﬁc rates to the World Standard Population \nﬁgures ( 12). Age-standardized rates enable a com -\nparison of rates in populations with different age \nstructures.\n The population counts used to estimate the rates \nof mortality for each country listed in Table A.4 \nare available from WHO (http://www3.who.int/\nwhosis/mort/table1.cfm?path=whosis,mort,mort\n_table1&language=english).\nWorld Bank data sources\nEstimates of levels of motorization (Table A.6) \nand several of the tables and ﬁgures that appear in \nchapters 2 and 3 are derived from World Bank data \nsources rather than WHO data.\n The World Bank obtains its data from several \nsources. Data on the number of trafﬁc fatalities and \nvehicle numbers (including all passenger cars, buses, \ntrucks and motorized two-wheelers) are taken from \nvarious editions of the International Road Federation’s \n(IRF) World road statistics yearbook, which date back to \nthe late 1960s. Since each IRF yearbook contains data \nfor the previous ﬁve years, each series can be com -\npared across editions to check for accuracy and to \nensure that all revisions have been properly recorded. \n In constructing the data sets presented in this \nreport, selected IRF data spanning the period 1968–\n2000 were compared with numerous regional and \ncountry-speciﬁc road safety studies. Population \nﬁgures came from the US Census Bureau’s interna -\ntional database and income data were taken from \nthe World Bank Global Development Network \nGrowth Database Macro Time Series. To account for \ndifferences in purchasing power across countries \nand to allow comparisons over time, real per capita \nGDP is measured in 1985 international prices. This \nseries was created from the Penn World Tables \n5.6, real per capita GDP variables for 1960–1992 \nand then extended to 1999 using GDP per capita ')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 193})","('type', 'Document')"

If the driver’s breath alcohol level is \nabove a set limit, the vehicle will not start.\nAnti-burst door latch:  door latch in a motor vehi -\ncle that is designed not to open under certain \nconditions in crashes, so preventing vehicle \noccupants from being ejected.\nArea-wide urban safety management:  trafﬁc \ncalming, trafﬁc safety management and speed \nreduction carried out in a particular urban \narea.\nAutomatic enforcement:  the enforcement of \nroad trafﬁc rules by means of equipment that \nrecords offences without requiring the pres -\nence of police ofﬁcers at the scene, such as \nspeed cameras or radar detectors.\nBarrier terminals:  the ends of safety barriers, which \noften need to be protected by crash cushions.\nBlood alcohol concentration (BAC):  the amount \nof alcohol present in the bloodstream, usually \ndenoted in grams per decilitre (g/dl). A legal \nBAC limit refers to the maximum amount of \nalcohol allowed in the bloodstream that is \nlegally acceptable for a driver on the road. In \nsome countries, the law stipulates an equivalent \nquantity of alcohol in the air breathed out, in \norder to facilitate detection of drink-driving.\nBreakaway columns:  lighting or telegraph poles, \ndesigned to break or collapse on impact.\nBreathalyser:  an instrument that measures the \nrelative quantity of alcohol in the air a person \nbreathes out.Bridge pier:  the support columns of bridges.\nBull-bars:  rigid or soft metal bars ﬁxed to the front \nof a sports utility vehicle, originally designed \nto prevent damage on contact with animals in \nrural areas.\nCentral refuges : areas in the middle of the car -\nriageway, where pedestrians can stop and wait \nuntil the road is clear before crossing.\nChange in velocity during a collision ( ΔV): in \ncrash reconstructions, the change in velocity \noccurring as a result of an impact – usually at \nthe centre of gravity of the vehicle – is widely \nused as the measure of the severity of a colli -\nsion. At substantial speeds, collisions between \ncars are almost totally inelastic so there is \nvery little rebound. Thus if a car travelling \nat 100 km/h strikes a stationary car of the \nsame mass, they will both undergo a change \nin velocity of 50 km/hr. ΔV is an important \nmeasure of the input severity or energy dos -\nage, that relates to the outcome or injury \nseverity. It is therefore a wdely used variable \nin assessing the characteristics of crashes \nand the beneﬁts of various countermeasures, \nsuch as the use of seat-belts and air bags, and \nchanges in speed limits.\nChicane:  a physical speed management measure \nconsisting of an obstacle on one or other side \nof the road, that has the effect of narrowing the \nwidth of the road.\nChild restraints:  special seat restraint for children, \ndesigned according to age and weight, offering \nprotection in the event of a car crash.\nClear zoning:  the systematic removal of all hazard -\nous features near the roadside, to minimize the \nchances of injury should a vehicle run off the \nroad.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 222})","('type', 'Document')"

"('page_content', 'The European Federation of Road Traffic Victims is deeply concerned about the millions of deaths, severely \ndisabled victims and often forgotten survivors of road traffic crashes as well as the huge psychological, social \nand economic impact of these incidents worldwide. We heartily welcome this report and strongly support \nthe call for an effective response.\nMarcel Haegi, President, European Federation of Road Traffic Victims, Switzerland \nRoad accidents are a never-ending drama. They are the leading cause of mortality among young people \nin industrialized countries. In other words, they are a health emergency to which governments must ﬁnd a \nresponse, and all the more so because they know what the remedies are: prevention, deterrence and making \nthe automobile industry face up to its responsibilities. This report is a contribution towards the efforts of those \nwho have decided, whether or not after a personal tragedy, to come to grips with this avoidable slaughter.\nGeneviéve Jurgensen, Founder and Spokesperson, League against Road Violence, France\nMany deaths and injuries from road crashes are completely preventable, especially those caused by alcohol or \ndrug-impaired drivers. WHO has done important work by focusing attention on road violence as a growing \nworldwide public health problem. This report will be a valuable resource for Mothers Against Drunk Driving \nand its allies in working to stop impaired driving and in supporting the victims of this crime.\nDean Wilkerson, Executive Director, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, United States of America The World Health Organization was established in 1948 as a specialized agency of the United Nations \nserving as the directing and coordinating authority for international health matters and public health. One of  \nWHO’s constitutional functions is to provide objective and reliable information and advice in the field of \nhuman health, a responsibility that it fulfils in part through its extensive programme of publications.\nThe Organization seeks through its publications to support national health strategies and address the most \npressing public health concerns of populations around the world. To respond to the needs of Member States \nat all levels of development, WHO publishes practical manuals, handbooks and training material for specific \ncategories of health workers; internationally applicable guidelines and standards; reviews and analyses of \nhealth policies, programmes and research and state-of-the-art consensus reports that offer technical advice \nand recommendations for decision-makers. These books are closely tied to the Organization’s priority \nactivities, encompassing disease prevention and control, the development of equitable health systems based \non primary health care, and health promotion for individuals and communities. Progress towards better health \nfor all also demands the global dissemination and exchange of information that draws on the knowledge \nand experience of all WHO’s Member countries and the collaboration of world leaders in public health and \nthe biomedical sciences.\nTo ensure the widest possible availability of authoritative information and guidance on health matters, \nWHO secures the broad international distribution of its publications and encourages their translation and \nadaptation. By helping to promote and protect health and prevent and control disease throughout the world, \nWHO’s books contribute to achieving the Organization’s principal objective – the attainment by all people of \nthe highest possible level of health.')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 242})","('type', 'Document')"

It is wrong to place the responsibility for causing and preventing road crashes on \nthe driver only; we need to look at the vehicle and the road as well.\nBen-Zion Kryger, Chairman, Yad-Haniktafim, Israel \nThere are not many roads, there is a single road that extends across the length and breadth of our vast \nplanet. Each of us is responsible for a segment of that road. The road safety decisions that we make or do \nnot make, ultimately have the power to affect the lives of people everywhere. We are one road – one world.\nRochelle Sobel, President, Association for Safe International Road Travel, United States of America \nThe human suffering for victims and their families of road traffic–related injuries is incalculable. There are \nendless repercussions: families break up; high counselling costs for the bereaved relatives; no income for a \nfamily if a breadwinner is lost; and thousands of rands to care for injured and paralysed people. Drive Alive \ngreatly welcomes this report and strongly supports its recommendations.\nMoira Winslow, Chairman, Drive Alive, South Africa \nWHO has decided to tackle the root causes of road accidents, a global scourge characteristic of our \ntechnological era, whose list of victims insidiously grows longer day by day. How many people die or are \ninjured? How many families have found themselves mourning, surrounded by indifference that is all too \ncommon, as if this state of affairs were an unavoidable tribute society has to pay for the right to travel? \nMay this bold report by WHO, with the assistance of ofﬁ  cial organizations and voluntary  associations, \nlead to greater and genuine awareness, to effective decisions and to deeper concern on the part of road \nusers for the lives of others.\nJacques Duhayon, Administrator, Association de Parents pour la Protection des Enfants sur les Routes, Belgium \nISBN 92 4 156260 9\nWorld report on road traffic injury prevention')","('metadata', {'source': './data/lib/pdf/world-report.pdf', 'page': 243})","('type', 'Document')"
